# Feature Specification: StormCom Multi-tenant E‑commerce Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-tenant-ecommerce`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: High-level request to build “StormCom,” a multi-tenant e‑commerce SaaS enabling businesses to manage products, orders, inventory, customers, marketing, content, POS, themes, and security with strong tenant isolation and a unified super admin dashboard.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17

- Q: Which SSO standard(s)/provider scope should be supported for enterprise SSO? → A: OIDC + SAML (both)
- Q: Which MFA method(s) should be supported? → A: Adopt the recommended stack: TOTP authenticator apps (RFC 6238) as the primary method with one‑time recovery codes; optional SMS fallback (opt‑in per tenant); optional WebAuthn/FIDO2 security keys for enterprises.
 - Q: External platform sync (scope, direction, frequency)? → Pending — to be decided in next clarification step (options will be proposed).

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Create and manage a store (Priority: P1)

As a Super Admin, I create a new store (tenant), assign a Store Admin, and set basic settings so the team can start managing products and sales.

**Why this priority**: Tenant provisioning is the entry point; nothing else is possible until a store exists and is staffed.

**Independent Test**: End-to-end create store → assign admin → admin can log in and access only that store.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given I am a Super Admin, When I create a store with a unique name and domain/slug, Then the store is created and visible in the stores list.
2. Given a new store exists, When I assign a Store Admin user, Then that user can log in and sees only their store data.
3. Given multiple stores exist, When a Store Admin navigates the dashboard, Then cross-tenant data is never visible.

### User Story 2 - Product catalog management with variants (Priority: P1)

As a Store Admin, I create products with variants, categories, brands, attributes, media, and labels, ensuring SKU/slug uniqueness and supporting bulk import/export.

**Why this priority**: A sellable catalog is essential to generate orders and revenue.

**Independent Test**: Create/edit/delete a product and its variants; import a CSV; export the catalog; verify uniqueness constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a store, When I create a product with name, description, price, category, brand, attributes, and images, Then the product is saved and visible in the catalog.
2. Given existing products, When I create a variant with its own SKU and price, Then the SKU is unique per store and inventory can be tracked per variant.
3. Given a CSV import file, When I run bulk import, Then products are created/updated with validation errors reported without importing invalid rows.
4. Given a need to share data, When I export products, Then I receive a CSV/Excel file with selected fields.

---

### User Story 3 - Order lifecycle and documents (Priority: P1)

As Staff, I process orders from pending to delivered, generate invoices/packing slips, send notifications, and handle cancellations/refunds.

**Why this priority**: Order fulfillment is the core operational process.

**Independent Test**: Place a test order, update status through all stages, generate documents, cancel/refund (including partial), and verify notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a new order, When I confirm it, Then stock deducts appropriately and an order number is generated.
2. Given a confirmed order, When I ship it, Then a packing slip is generated and the customer receives a shipment notification.
3. Given an order with returned items, When I create a partial refund, Then the refund amount cannot exceed captured payment and returned items restock if configured.
4. Given unpaid orders after the configured window, When the auto-cancel job runs, Then those orders are canceled and stock is restored.

---

### User Story 4 - Inventory tracking and alerts (Priority: P1)

As a Store Admin, I maintain accurate stock per product/variant with audit trails and receive low‑stock alerts.

**Why this priority**: Prevents overselling and ensures replenishment.

**Independent Test**: Adjust stock manually, confirm an order to deduct stock, cancel/refund to restore stock, verify low‑stock alert is triggered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a product variant, When I set stock to a value, Then that change is recorded in an audit trail with actor, reason, and timestamp.
2. Given a low‑stock threshold, When stock falls below it, Then an alert appears on the dashboard and optional notification is sent.
3. Given concurrent orders, When stock would go negative, Then the second order fails with a clear message and no negative stock occurs.

---

### User Story 5 - Customer management and analytics (Priority: P2)

As a Store Admin, I view customer profiles, addresses, order history, spending, wish‑lists, and analytics; I can search and filter customers.

**Independent Test**: Create a customer, add addresses, place orders, view lifetime value (LTV), manage wish‑lists, and run a filtered search.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a customer profile, When I open it, Then I see contact details, addresses, order history, total spending, and wish‑listed items.
2. Given many customers, When I filter by LTV and last order date, Then matching customers are returned quickly with export capability.

---

### User Story 6 - Marketing campaigns (Priority: P2)

As a Marketing Manager, I create coupons, flash sales, newsletters, and abandoned‑cart campaigns, schedule them, and track performance.

**Independent Test**: Create a coupon, schedule a flash sale, run an abandoned‑cart campaign, and view campaign metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a coupon code, When I define discount rules and validity, Then eligible orders receive the discount and redemptions are tracked.
2. Given carts older than N hours, When I run recovery, Then messages are sent and recovered orders are attributed to the campaign.

---

### User Story 7 - Content management (Priority: P2)

As a Content Manager, I manage pages, blogs, menus, FAQs, and testimonials to keep the storefront updated.

**Independent Test**: Create pages and posts, organize menus, add FAQs/testimonials, and publish/unpublish content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a new page, When I publish it, Then it appears on the storefront and in menus where configured.
2. Given a testimonial, When I approve it, Then it becomes visible under the relevant product or page section.

---

### User Story 8 - Dashboards and reports (Priority: P2)

As an Analyst or Store Admin, I view KPIs and export sales/inventory/customer reports with configurable thresholds.

**Independent Test**: Open dashboard, adjust thresholds, export reports to CSV/Excel, verify figures match underlying data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given set thresholds, When a metric crosses a threshold, Then it is highlighted and optionally notifies users.
2. Given a date range and filters, When I export sales data, Then the file contains accurate, filtered records.

---

### User Story 9 - POS checkout (Priority: P3)

As a Store Staff member, I process in‑store transactions via POS and print receipts.

**Independent Test**: Add items to cart, apply coupon, accept payment, issue receipt, and update inventory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given POS access, When I scan/select products, Then prices, taxes, and discounts are applied and total is computed.
2. Given successful payment, When I complete the sale, Then inventory is updated and a receipt is generated.

---

### User Story 10 - Security and access control (Priority: P1)

As a Security Admin, I enforce strong passwords, MFA, account lockouts, RBAC, and audit logs.

**Independent Test**: Configure password rules, enable MFA, trigger lockout by repeated failures, review permissions and audit trails.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given password requirements, When a weak password is used, Then the system rejects it with guidance.
2. Given MFA enabled, When a user logs in, Then a second factor is required.
3. Given RBAC policies, When a user without permission attempts an action, Then access is denied and logged.

---

### Edge Cases

- Duplicate SKU or slug within the same store must fail with a clear message; across stores is allowed.
- Concurrent orders reducing the same variant stock must not produce negative inventory; second attempt fails gracefully.
- Auto‑cancel unpaid orders must not cancel orders that received late payments; idempotent processing.
- Partial refunds cannot exceed total paid and cannot double‑restock items.
- CSV import with invalid rows: valid rows import; invalid rows report precise reasons; import is resumable.
- Staff switching stores must not retain cached data or permissions from previous store.
- POS device time drift must not corrupt order timestamps; rely on server time for order creation.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

Assumptions
- CSV/Excel import/export is acceptable for operational data exchange in back office.
- Server time is the canonical source for order timestamps and SLA calculations (not client devices).
- Default auto‑cancel window is 60 minutes unless changed by store configuration.
- Notifications are sent via email by default; additional channels (e.g., SMS/push) may be added later.
- Theme customization is limited to provided presets and safe configurable options; no arbitrary code injection.
- Reasonable dataset sizes for interactive queries (typical mid‑market stores); very large datasets may require archiving/BI tooling.
- Standard e‑commerce privacy and data retention practices apply unless stricter policies are configured by the store.

Dependencies
- Payment providers for capturing, refunding, and reconciling payments (per store).
- Email (and optionally SMS) service providers for notifications.
- Optional SSO and MFA providers where enabled.
- Optional platform connectors for external e‑commerce integrations.
- Background job scheduling for auto‑cancel, abandoned‑cart recovery, and notifications.
- Secure, immutable audit log storage.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Super Admins can create and staff a new store in under 5 minutes, and the assigned admin can log in immediately.
- **SC-002**: 100% of product and variant SKUs and slugs are unique per store; validation occurs before save with clear messaging.
- **SC-003**: 95% of order status updates from pending to confirmed occur within 10 seconds of user action (user‑perceived immediate feedback).
- **SC-004**: Inventory never goes negative; concurrent order attempts on low stock result in exactly one success and clear feedback on the other.
- **SC-005**: Low‑stock alerts appear on dashboards within 1 minute of the triggering change and are included in the next notification run.
- **SC-006**: Auto‑cancel removes ≥ 99% of unpaid orders past the configured window without canceling any paid orders (0 false positives in tests).
- **SC-007**: Customer search/filter returns the first page of results with applied filters in under 2 seconds for typical datasets (user‑perceived instant response).
- **SC-008**: Reports and exports reflect applied filters accurately; exported files match on‑screen totals within 0.5% variance.
- **SC-009**: 100% of security‑sensitive actions are captured in audit logs with actor, timestamp, entity, and outcome.
- **SC-010**: After enabling MFA and lockout policies, unauthorized login attempts result in lockout after the configured threshold 100% of the time in tests.
