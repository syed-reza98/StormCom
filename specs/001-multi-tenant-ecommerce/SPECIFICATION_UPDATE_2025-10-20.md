# Specification Update Summary: Authentication & Authorization

**Feature**: StormCom Multi-tenant E-commerce Platform  
**Branch**: `001-multi-tenant-ecommerce`  
**Updated**: 2025-10-20  
**Changes**: Added comprehensive authentication and authorization specification

---

## Overview

Updated the StormCom specification to include detailed authentication and authorization requirements, specifically covering Super Admin login, Store Admin/Staff login, Customer login, and comprehensive security measures. The update adds User Story 0 as a P0 (blocking priority) feature since authentication is the entry point to the entire system.

---

## Changes Summary

### 1. Added User Story 0 - Authentication and Authorization (Priority: P0)

**Location**: `specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/spec.md` (inserted before User Story 1)

**User Story**: As a Super Admin, Store Admin, Staff member, or Customer, I need to authenticate securely with my credentials to access the appropriate areas of the system based on my role.

**Coverage**: 20 acceptance scenarios across 5 categories:

1. **Super Admin Login** (8 scenarios):
   - Login form layout and field validation
   - Valid credentials authentication and redirect
   - Invalid email format validation
   - Invalid credentials error handling
   - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - Forgot password flow
   - MFA prompt when enabled
   - Cross-store access permissions

2. **Store Admin/Staff Login** (3 scenarios):
   - Store-specific dashboard access
   - Permission-based access control
   - Inactive account prevention

3. **Customer Login** (3 scenarios):
   - Customer account page redirect
   - Guest registration option
   - Session expiration after inactivity

4. **Session Management** (2 scenarios):
   - Session invalidation on password change
   - Session termination on permission revocation
   - Idle timeout enforcement

5. **Password Requirements** (4 scenarios):
   - Length requirement (min 8 characters)
   - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
   - Password history validation (last 5 passwords)
   - Secure bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12)

## Impact on Existing Specification

### User Story Renumbering

**No renumbering required**. User Story 0 is inserted before User Story 1, but all existing user stories retain their original numbers:

- **NEW**: User Story 0 - Authentication and Authorization (P0)
- User Story 1 - Create and manage a store (P1)
- User Story 2 - Product catalog management (P1)
- User Story 3 - Checkout with shipping and tax (P1)
- User Story 3a - Customer storefront browsing (P1)
- User Story 4 - Order lifecycle and documents (P1)
- User Story 5 - Subscription plan selection (P1)
- User Story 6 - Inventory tracking and alerts (P1)
- User Story 12 - Security and access control (P1) [remains as high-level security overview]
- User Story 13 - External platform integration (P2)
- User Story 14 - GDPR compliance (P1)

### Relationship to User Story 12

User Story 12 (Security and access control) remains in place as a high-level security overview covering password rules, MFA setup, and RBAC policy configuration. User Story 0 provides detailed login/authentication flows and user-facing scenarios, while US12 focuses on security administration and enforcement.
