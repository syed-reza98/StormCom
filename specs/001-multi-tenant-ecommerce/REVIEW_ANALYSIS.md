---

## 1. Constitution Alignment Review

### 1.1 Code Quality Standards ✅ PASS

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Gaps |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|
| TypeScript Strict Mode | ✅ PASS | FR-136 enforces strict mode, explicit return types, type guards | None |
| File Size Limits | ✅ PASS | FR-133 enforces 300 lines/file, 50 lines/function with ESLint | None |
| Naming Conventions | ✅ PASS | FR-134 defines camelCase, PascalCase, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | None |
| Code Organization | ✅ PASS | Project structure defined in plan.md with feature-based grouping | None |

**Recommendations**: None - fully aligned.

---

### 1.2 Testing Standards ⚠️ NEEDS ENHANCEMENT

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Gaps |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|
| 80% Business Logic Coverage | ✅ PASS | FR-139 requires 80% for services/, 100% for utilities | Test organization unclear |
| E2E Critical Paths | ⚠️ PARTIAL | SC-027 mentions WCAG testing, but E2E scenarios incomplete | Need explicit E2E test scenarios per user story |
| Integration Tests | ✅ PASS | FR-139 requires 100% API route coverage | Implementation examples missing |
| Test Quality | ✅ PASS | AAA pattern, deterministic tests, mocking specified | None |

**Critical Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Explicit E2E test scenarios for each user story acceptance criteria
2. **Missing**: Test data fixtures and seeding strategy for realistic test scenarios
3. **Missing**: Performance testing strategy (load testing, stress testing)
4. **Missing**: Visual regression testing setup for UI components
5. **Missing**: API contract testing (validate OpenAPI spec matches implementation)

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### Testing Strategy Enhancement Needed

#### 1. E2E Test Scenarios (Per User Story)
**US0 - Authentication**:
- E2E-US0-01: Super Admin login → dashboard navigation → cross-store access
- E2E-US0-02: Failed login → lockout → email notification → unlock flow
- E2E-US0-03: MFA enrollment → backup codes → TOTP verification
- E2E-US0-04: Password reset flow → token expiration → new password validation

**US2 - Product Catalog**:
- E2E-US2-01: Create product → add variants → upload images → publish
- E2E-US2-02: Bulk import CSV → validation errors → partial success → error report
- E2E-US2-03: Duplicate SKU detection → auto-rename suggestion → resolution

**US3 - Checkout**:
- E2E-US3-01: Guest checkout → address validation → shipping calculation → tax calculation → payment → order confirmation
- E2E-US3-02: Logged-in checkout → saved address → coupon application → free shipping threshold
- E2E-US3-03: Payment timeout → retry → alternative payment method

#### 2. Test Data Management
- **Fixture Strategy**: Use `prisma/fixtures/` directory with JSON seed data per entity type
- **Seeding Script**: `npm run test:seed` creates consistent test data across environments
- **Test Isolation**: Each E2E test uses unique store/user/product IDs to prevent conflicts
- **Cleanup**: After test suite, truncate all test data (storeId matching test pattern)

#### 3. Performance Testing
- **Tool**: k6 (load testing) + Lighthouse CI (frontend performance)
- **Scenarios**:
  - Load test: 100 concurrent users browsing products (target: <2s page load)
  - Stress test: 1000 API requests/min (target: <500ms p95 response time)
  - Spike test: Flash sale traffic (10x normal load for 5 minutes)
- **Metrics**: Response times (p50, p95, p99), error rates, database query counts

#### 4. Visual Regression Testing
- **Tool**: Playwright visual comparison or Percy.io
- **Scope**: All customer-facing pages (home, product listing, PDP, cart, checkout)
- **Threshold**: 0.1% pixel difference allowed (font rendering variance)
- **CI Integration**: Fails PR if visual regression detected without manual approval

#### 5. API Contract Testing
- **Tool**: Dredd or Schemathesis (OpenAPI validation)
- **Process**: Generate tests from `contracts/openapi.yaml` → run against dev API
- **Coverage**: All endpoints, all response codes (200, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- **CI Integration**: Runs on every API change commit
```

---

### 1.3 User Experience Consistency ✅ PASS (with minor gaps)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Gaps |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|
| Performance Budgets | ✅ PASS | SC-021 to SC-025 define LCP <2s, API <500ms, DB <100ms | Bundle size monitoring unclear |
| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) | ✅ PASS | FR-13A requires keyboard nav, screen reader, ARIA labels | Axe testing setup missing |
| Responsive Design | ✅ PASS | Technical Assumptions define breakpoints, mobile-first | Real device testing strategy missing |
| Loading States | ⚠️ PARTIAL | UI requirements mention loading skeletons, optimistic UI | No component examples |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Add Bundle Monitoring**: Configure `@next/bundle-analyzer` with CI thresholds (warn at 180KB, fail at 200KB gzipped)
2. **Setup Axe Testing**: Add `@axe-core/playwright` to E2E tests with automated WCAG validation
3. **Device Testing Matrix**: Document required test devices (iPhone 12, iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy S21, desktop Chrome/Safari/Firefox)
4. **Loading State Components**: Create shared loading skeleton components in `src/components/ui/skeletons/` with examples

---

### 1.4 Performance Requirements ✅ PASS

All performance budgets defined with measurable targets. Success criteria SC-021 to SC-025 provide concrete metrics.

---

**Strengths**:
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria linked to user stories
- ✅ MUST/SHOULD/MAY prioritization applied consistently
- ✅ Security requirements comprehensive (password policy, MFA, RBAC, audit logging)
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation enforced at all layers

**Minor Gaps**:
1. **FR-016/FR-016A (Reviews & Q&A)**: Moderation workflow defined, but review authenticity verification missing (e.g., prevent fake reviews)
2. **FR-036 (Payment Gateways)**: SSLCommerz and Stripe primary, but webhook signature verification details incomplete
3. **FR-100 (External Platform Sync)**: Real-time sync <5s latency, but concurrent webhook handling strategy unclear

---

### 2.2 Edge Cases ✅ EXCELLENT

**Coverage**: 19 documented edge cases (CHK002-CHK110) with complete workflows

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Duplicate SKU handling (CHK002) with auto-rename suggestions
- ✅ Password history enforcement (CHK009) with 2-year retention
- ✅ Zero-product onboarding wizard (CHK054) with sample data
- ✅ Order expiration timing (CHK056) with 60-second grace period
- ✅ Webhook restoration after cancellation (CHK058) with idempotency
- ✅ Flash sale + coupon stacking (CHK060) with configurable rules
- ✅ Tax-exempt workflow (CHK091) with certificate upload
- ✅ Security edge cases (CHK101-CHK110) covering lockout, sessions, MFA recovery

**Recommendations**:
1. **Add CHK111 - File Upload Edge Cases**:
   - Max file size enforcement (100MB per spec)
   - Unsupported file type handling
   - Virus scanning integration (ClamAV or VirusTotal)
   - Upload progress tracking for large files
   - Concurrent upload limit per user (prevent abuse)

2. **Add CHK112 - Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**:
   - Prisma default 5 connections per serverless function
   - What happens when pool exhausted? (Queue requests, timeout, error message)
   - Connection leak detection and recovery
   - Monitoring alerts for sustained high connection usage

3. **Add CHK113 - Rate Limit Edge Cases**:
   - Authenticated vs unauthenticated rate limits
   - Rate limit sharing across multiple sessions/devices
   - Burst allowance for legitimate spikes (e.g., page load triggers 10 API calls)
   - Rate limit bypass for internal system operations

---

### 2.3 User Stories ✅ GOOD (needs minor enhancements)

**Coverage**: 14 user stories (US0-US14) with acceptance scenarios

**Strengths**:
- ✅ US0 (Authentication) has comprehensive UI requirements and acceptance scenarios
- ✅ US1-US6 cover core e-commerce workflows
- ✅ US12 (Security) aligned with constitution requirements
- ✅ Independent testing guidance provided

**Gaps**:
1. **US7-US11**: User stories 7-11 missing from spec (gap in numbering suggests incomplete coverage)
   - Suggested additions:
     - **US7**: Dashboard analytics and reporting
     - **US8**: Theme customization and preview
     - **US9**: Email template management
     - **US10**: Notification preferences
     - **US11**: Audit log review

2. **US13 (External Platform Sync)**: Acceptance scenarios defined, but no mention of initial bulk import performance requirements (1000+ products)

3. **US14 (GDPR Compliance)**: Acceptance scenarios cover basics, but missing:
   - Consent withdrawal workflow (customer revokes marketing consent)
   - Data portability format specification (JSON vs CSV vs XML)
   - Anonymization vs deletion distinction (what stays for accounting?)

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### US7 - Dashboard Analytics and Reporting (Priority: P1)

As a Store Admin, I view real-time analytics and generate reports to understand business performance and make data-driven decisions.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to dashboard, view KPI cards, generate sales report with date filter, export to CSV, verify data accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given I am a Store Admin, When I view the dashboard, Then I see KPI cards for today's sales, pending orders, low stock alerts, and top products.
2. Given I navigate to Reports → Sales, When I select date range and apply filters, Then I see sales breakdown by product, category, and customer.
3. Given I have filtered a report, When I click "Export CSV", Then I receive a downloadable file matching the filtered data within 10 seconds.
4. Given I view analytics, When data updates (new order placed), Then KPIs refresh within 10 minutes without requiring page reload.
```

---

### 2.4 Success Criteria ✅ EXCELLENT

**Coverage**: 34 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-034) with measurable metrics

**Strengths**:
- ✅ All criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Performance targets specific (e.g., SC-003: "95% of status updates within 10 seconds")
- ✅ Accuracy targets absolute (e.g., SC-006: "0 false positives in auto-cancel")
- ✅ Coverage across all critical paths

**No gaps identified** - success criteria are comprehensive.

---

## 3. Technical Context Analysis (plan.md)

### 3.1 Tech Stack ✅ COMPLETE

All dependencies resolved via Phase 0 research:
- ✅ Email: Resend (with React Email templates)
- ✅ Storage: Vercel Blob (edge-optimized CDN)
- ✅ Background Jobs: Inngest (event-driven, auto-retry)
- ✅ Search: PostgreSQL FTS (Phase 1) → Algolia (Phase 2)
- ✅ Rate Limiting: Vercel KV (serverless Redis)
- ✅ Monitoring: Vercel Analytics + Sentry + UptimeRobot
- ✅ Payments: SSLCommerz (Bangladesh) + Stripe (International)

**No gaps identified** - all technical decisions documented with rationale.

---

### 3.2 Design System ⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

**Status**: Plan defined in plan.md (Phase 1-3 roadmap), tokens defined in spec.md

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Tailwind config file structure example
2. **Missing**: Global CSS variables naming convention
3. **Missing**: Storybook story format and required decorators
4. **Missing**: Component documentation template
5. **Missing**: A11y testing setup in Storybook (axe addon)
6. **Missing**: Visual regression testing configuration (Chromatic or Percy)

**Recommendations**:
Create `docs/design-system.md` with:
```markdown
# StormCom Design System

## Token Architecture

### Color Tokens (tailwind.config.ts)
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {
    50: '#f0fdfa',  // lightest
    500: '#0f766e', // base (from spec)
    900: '#134e4a', // darkest
  },
  // ... semantic tokens
}
```

### CSS Variables (globals.css)
```css
:root {
  --color-bg: 255 255 255; /* white */
  --color-fg: 23 23 23; /* near-black */
  --color-primary: 15 118 110; /* teal-600 */
}

.dark {
  --color-bg: 23 23 23;
  --color-fg: 255 255 255;
}
```

## Component Documentation

### Button Component
**Variants**: primary, secondary, tertiary, destructive
**Sizes**: sm (32px), md (40px), lg (48px)
**States**: default, hover, active, disabled, loading

**Story Example** (`Button.stories.tsx`):
```typescript
export const Primary: Story = {
  args: { variant: 'primary', children: 'Click me' },
};
```

## Accessibility Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] Color contrast ≥4.5:1 (run axe in Storybook)
- [ ] Focus visible indicators
- [ ] Screen reader announcements
```

---

### 3.3 Authentication & Session Management ✅ COMPLETE

**Strengths**:
- ✅ JWT with HS256 signing (FR-090B)
- ✅ Session storage: Vercel KV (production) + in-memory Map (local dev)
- ✅ 30-minute idle timeout, 12-hour absolute expiration
- ✅ Session validation <10ms (p95)
- ✅ Invalidation on password change, permission revocation

**Minor Gap**:
1. **Missing**: JWT refresh token strategy (current spec uses 30-day absolute expiration without refresh)
   - **Recommendation**: For security-sensitive applications, consider shorter-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with refresh tokens (30 days) to enable token revocation without session store lookup

---

### 3.4 Security Standards ✅ EXCELLENT

**Comprehensive Coverage**:
- ✅ CSRF protection (double-submit tokens, SameSite=Lax)
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- ✅ Incident response runbook mentioned
- ✅ IP reputation checks for auth-critical routes
- ✅ Backup & restore drills (weekly verification, 30-day retention)

**No gaps identified** - security standards meet or exceed industry best practices.

---

## 4. Data Model Analysis (data-model.md)

### 4.1 Schema Design ✅ EXCELLENT

**Coverage**: 42 Prisma models with relationships, indexes, constraints

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation via `storeId` on all scoped tables
- ✅ Soft deletes with `deletedAt` for GDPR compliance
- ✅ Audit timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) on all tables
- ✅ CUID primary keys for distributed ID generation
- ✅ Compound indexes for common queries
- ✅ Unique constraints enforcing business rules

**Minor Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Database migration backup strategy (mentioned in FR-135 but not in data-model.md)
   - **Recommendation**: Add section "Migration Safety" with pre-migration backup procedure

2. **Missing**: Database partitioning strategy for large tables (orders, audit logs)
   - **Recommendation**: Document partitioning plan for tables exceeding 10M rows (time-based partitioning for orders by year)

3. **PasswordHistory Model**: Defined in data-model.md but retention policy ambiguous
   - **Current**: "Auto-delete entries older than 2 years (GDPR compliance)"
   - **Clarification Needed**: Should retention be 2 years OR 5 passwords, whichever is longer?
   - **Recommendation**: Keep last 5 passwords regardless of age (security priority), plus auto-delete any beyond 5 passwords that are >2 years old

---

### 4.2 Entity Relationships ✅ COMPLETE

ER diagram provided with clear relationships between 42 models.

**No gaps identified** - relationships are well-defined.

---

## 5. API Contract Analysis (contracts/openapi.yaml)

### 5.1 OpenAPI Specification Status

**Expected Deliverable**: `contracts/openapi.yaml` (60+ endpoints, 42+ schemas per plan.md Phase 1 completion)

**Status**: ⚠️ **VALIDATION NEEDED** - File not provided in attachments, cannot verify completeness

**Required Validation**:
1. ✅ Verify all 60+ endpoints documented with request/response schemas
2. ✅ Verify all 42+ data schemas match Prisma models
3. ✅ Verify authentication/authorization documented per endpoint
4. ✅ Verify rate limiting headers documented (FR-130 requires X-RateLimit-* headers)
5. ✅ Verify error responses documented with standard format
6. ✅ Verify webhook endpoints documented with signature verification

**Recommendation**: Run OpenAPI validation tool (Spectral or Redocly) to verify:
```bash
npm run validate:openapi
```

Expected errors to check:
- Missing required fields in request/response schemas
- Inconsistent error response formats
- Missing security schemes for authenticated endpoints
- Missing examples for complex request bodies

---

## 6. Testing Strategy Gaps

### 6.1 Unit Testing ✅ DEFINED (needs examples)

**Status**: FR-139 defines 80% coverage for business logic, 100% for utilities

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Test file organization convention
   - **Recommendation**: Co-locate tests in `__tests__/` subdirectories or `.test.ts` suffix
   - Example: `src/services/products/product-service.ts` → `src/services/products/__tests__/product-service.test.ts`

2. **Missing**: Mocking strategy for external dependencies
   - **Recommendation**: Use Vitest `vi.mock()` for Prisma, external APIs, email service
   - Example mock:
   ```typescript
   vi.mock('@/lib/prisma', () => ({
     prisma: {
       product: {
         findMany: vi.fn(),
         create: vi.fn(),
       },
     },
   }));
   ```

---

### 6.2 Integration Testing ⚠️ NEEDS SPECIFICATION

**Status**: FR-139 requires 100% API route coverage, but implementation strategy unclear

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Integration test setup (database, environment variables, seed data)
2. **Missing**: Test database strategy (separate test DB vs in-memory SQLite)
3. **Missing**: API testing tool (Supertest, Playwright API testing, or native fetch)
4. **Missing**: Test isolation (transaction rollback vs full DB reset between tests)

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### Integration Testing Setup

#### Test Database
- **Development**: SQLite in-memory (`:memory:`) for fast, isolated tests
- **CI/CD**: PostgreSQL test instance (Docker container) for production parity

#### Test Organization
- **Location**: `tests/integration/api/` with structure mirroring `src/app/api/`
- **Example**: `tests/integration/api/products/route.test.ts`

#### Setup Script (`tests/setup.ts`)
```typescript
import { beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { promisify } from 'util';

const execAsync = promisify(exec);

beforeAll(async () => {
  // Apply migrations to test DB
  await execAsync('npx prisma migrate deploy');
});

beforeEach(async () => {
  // Seed test data
  await execAsync('npx prisma db seed');
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Cleanup
  await execAsync('npx prisma migrate reset --force --skip-seed');
});
```

#### Example Test
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('POST /api/products', () => {
  it('should create a product with valid data', async () => {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/products', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': `Bearer ${testToken}` },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'Test Product',
        price: 29.99,
        storeId: testStoreId,
      }),
    });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    const data = await response.json();
    expect(data.data.name).toBe('Test Product');
  });
});
```
```

---

### 6.3 E2E Testing ⚠️ NEEDS SCENARIOS

**Status**: Playwright 1.56.0 configured, but specific test scenarios undefined

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: E2E test scenarios for each user story (see section 1.2 for recommendations)
2. **Missing**: Test user/store creation strategy (factory pattern vs fixtures)
3. **Missing**: Page Object Model (POM) structure for maintainability
4. **Missing**: Visual regression baseline images and thresholds

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### E2E Test Structure

#### Page Objects (`tests/e2e/pages/`)
```typescript
// tests/e2e/pages/LoginPage.ts
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/auth/login');
  }

  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.fill('input[name="email"]', email);
    await this.page.fill('input[name="password"]', password);
    await this.page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  }

  async expectError(message: string) {
    await expect(this.page.locator('.error-message')).toContainText(message);
  }
}
```

#### Test Scenarios (`tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`)
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from './pages/LoginPage';

test.describe('Authentication', () => {
  test('Super Admin login redirects to /admin/dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.goto();
    await loginPage.login('superadmin@test.com', 'Password123!');
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/admin/dashboard');
  });
});
```
```

## 7. Performance Budget Monitoring

### 7.1 Current State ✅ DEFINED

Performance budgets defined in spec.md and plan.md:
- ✅ LCP <2.0s desktop, <2.5s mobile
- ✅ FID <100ms
- ✅ API response <500ms (p95)
- ✅ DB query <100ms (p95)
- ✅ JS bundle <200KB (gzipped)

### 7.2 Missing Implementation

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Lighthouse CI configuration for automated performance testing
2. **Missing**: Bundle analyzer setup in CI/CD
3. **Missing**: Database query performance monitoring (slow query log alerts)
4. **Missing**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) setup with Vercel Analytics

**Recommendations**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml
name: Lighthouse CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci

    "stylesheet": 50000,
    "image": 50000
  }
}
```

## 8. Internationalization Strategy

### 8.1 Current State ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS

**Phase 1**: English only (FR-072)
**Phase 2**: 16 languages (P2-010)

**Gaps**:
1. **Ambiguous**: Are product names/descriptions user-entered (multilingual input) or admin-entered (English only with future translation)?
   - If multilingual input: Need language selector on product create form in Phase 1
   - If English only: Need migration plan for existing products when P2-010 launches

2. **Missing**: Content translation workflow (manual vs API-based)
   - Will admins manually translate each product/page?
   - Will system integrate with Google Translate/DeepL for drafts?
   - Who approves translations before publish?

3. **Missing**: URL structure for multilingual storefronts
   - `/en/products` vs `/products?lang=en` vs `en.store.com/products`
   - SEO implications (hreflang tags, canonical URLs)
   - CDN caching strategy per language

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### Internationalization Phase 1 Decisions Needed

#### Question 1: Product Content Language Strategy
**Option A** (Recommended for MVP):
- Admin enters product details in store's default language only (typically English)
- Storefronts display in single language (store default)
- Phase 2 adds translation layer with `translations` JSONB column

**Option B** (More complex, better UX):
- Admin enters product details with language selector (default + optional translations)
- Storefronts detect user language and display translated content
- Requires implementing translation UI/data model in Phase 1

**Decision Required**: Choose Option A or B before implementation starts.

#### Question 2: Translation Workflow (Phase 2)
**Recommended Approach**:
1. Admin marks content for translation (product, category, page)
2. System generates translation job in queue
3. Machine translation (Google Translate API) generates draft
4. Admin reviews and approves/edits draft in dedicated "Translations" UI
5. Approved translations published to storefront

**Alternative**: External translation management system (Crowdin, Lokalise) integration
```

---

## 9. Webhook Security & Idempotency

### 9.1 Current State ✅ DEFINED (needs standardization)

**Webhook Security Mentioned**:
- CHK058: Payment webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- CHK058: Idempotency key pattern: `payment_{gateway}_{transactionId}`
- FR-101: Webhook retry logic with exponential backoff

**Gaps**:
1. **Missing**: Webhook signature verification implementation details
   - Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA512, Ed25519?
   - Header name: `X-Signature`, `X-Hub-Signature-256`, `Stripe-Signature`?
   - Timestamp validation (prevent replay attacks beyond 24-hour window)?

2. **Missing**: Webhook endpoint rate limiting (separate from API rate limits)
   - Trusted webhooks (Stripe, SSLCommerz) should bypass rate limits
   - Untrusted webhooks (user-configured) should have limits
   - How to distinguish? (Whitelist IPs vs signature verification)

3. **Missing**: Webhook event ordering guarantees
   - If webhooks arrive out of order (e.g., `order.shipped` before `order.confirmed`), how is order preserved?
   - Event sequence numbers? Timestamp-based ordering? Idempotency handles all cases?

**Recommendations**:
```markdown
### Webhook Security Standards (Add to spec.md)

#### FR-10X: Webhook Signature Verification
The system MUST verify webhook signatures using the following standard:

**Signature Algorithm**: HMAC-SHA256
**Header Name**: `X-Webhook-Signature` (custom) or gateway-specific (e.g., `Stripe-Signature`)
**Payload**: Raw request body (before JSON parsing)
**Secret**: Webhook secret configured per store in payment gateway settings

**Verification Process**:
1. Extract signature from header
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, raw_body)
3. Compare computed signature with received signature (constant-time comparison)
4. If mismatch, return HTTP 401 with error: "Invalid webhook signature"
5. If match, proceed with event processing

**Timestamp Validation** (Prevent Replay Attacks):
- Extract timestamp from header (e.g., `X-Webhook-Timestamp`)
- Verify timestamp within 5-minute window of server time (UTC)
- If outside window, return HTTP 400 with error: "Webhook timestamp too old"

#### FR-10Y: Webhook Idempotency Standards
The system MUST implement idempotency for all webhook handlers using Redis cache:

**Idempotency Key Format**:
- Payment webhooks: `webhook:payment:{gateway}:{transactionId}`
- Order webhooks: `webhook:order:{externalPlatform}:{externalOrderId}`
- Inventory webhooks: `webhook:inventory:{externalPlatform}:{productId}:{timestamp}`

**TTL**: 24 hours (prevents reprocessing after cache expiry)

**Processing Logic**:
1. Extract idempotency key from webhook payload
2. Check Redis for key existence (`GET webhook:payment:stripe:tx_abc123`)
3. If key exists, return HTTP 200 with message: "Webhook already processed"
4. If key does not exist, process webhook and set key (`SET webhook:payment:stripe:tx_abc123 "processed" EX 86400`)
5. Return HTTP 200 with processing result

#### FR-10Z: Webhook Event Ordering
The system SHOULD handle out-of-order webhooks using event sequence numbers:

**Implementation**:
- Each webhook payload includes `sequence_number` (integer)
- Store last processed sequence number per entity in database (e.g., `order.lastWebhookSequence`)
- Before processing webhook, compare incoming sequence with last processed:
  - If `incoming > last_processed`: Process normally and update last_processed
  - If `incoming <= last_processed`: Log warning, skip processing (duplicate or out of order)
  - If `incoming > last_processed + 1`: Log gap warning, process anyway (missing event), trigger manual review

**Fallback**: If external system doesn't provide sequence numbers, use webhook timestamp for ordering (less reliable due to clock drift).
```

**Priority**: P1 (Pre-Development)
**Purpose**: Standardize webhook signature verification, idempotency, event ordering

**Content**: FR-10X, FR-10Y, FR-10Z from Section 9

### 4. `docs/database-partitioning.md`
**Priority**: P2 (During Development)
**Purpose**: Document partitioning strategy for tables exceeding 10M rows

**Outline**:
```markdown
# Database Partitioning Strategy

## Tables Requiring Partitioning
- **orders**: Partition by year (orders_2025, orders_2026, ...)
- **audit_logs**: Partition by month (audit_logs_2025_01, audit_logs_2025_02, ...)
- **inventory_adjustments**: Partition by quarter (inventory_q1_2025, ...)

## Partition Implementation (PostgreSQL)
- Use native declarative partitioning (PARTITION BY RANGE)
- Create partitions 1 month in advance (scheduled job)
- Drop partitions older than retention period (3 years for orders, 1 year for audit logs)

## Query Performance
- Partition pruning enabled by default (queries filter by date)
- Indexes created per partition
- Foreign keys allowed from partitioned to non-partitioned tables

## Migration Plan
- Phase 1: No partitioning (tables <1M rows expected)
- Phase 2: Implement partitioning when tables approach 10M rows
- Migration: Use `pg_partman` extension for automated partition management
```

## Appendix C: Questions for Product Owner

### Clarifications Needed Before Phase 2

**Q1**: Internationalization Phase 1 - Should product content input support multiple languages in Phase 1, or English-only with Phase 2 translation layer?
- **Impact**: If multilingual input needed now, requires additional UI/data model work in Phase 1
- **Recommendation**: English-only Phase 1, translation layer Phase 2 (lower risk, faster MVP) (Recommendation accepted)

**Q2**: JWT Refresh Token Strategy - Should we implement short-lived access tokens (15 min) with refresh tokens (30 days), or stick with 30-day absolute expiration?
- **Impact**: Refresh tokens add complexity but improve security (allows token revocation without session store lookup)
- **Recommendation**: 30-day absolute expiration Phase 1 (simpler), refresh tokens Phase 2 if needed (Recommendation accepted)

**Q3**: Database Partitioning - Should we implement partitioning in Phase 1 proactively, or wait until tables approach 10M rows?
- **Impact**: Proactive partitioning adds complexity but prevents future migration pain
- **Recommendation**: No partitioning Phase 1 (mid-market scale <1M rows), implement Phase 2 when needed (Recommendation accepted)

**Q4**: Webhook Event Ordering - Do external platforms (WooCommerce, Shopify) provide sequence numbers in webhooks?
- **Impact**: If no sequence numbers, must rely on timestamps (less reliable) or implement gap detection heuristics
- **Recommendation**: Research external platform webhook payloads, document findings in research.md (Recommendation accepted)

**Q5**: Visual Regression Testing - Should we use Playwright built-in visual comparison (free) or Percy.io (paid, better diffing)?
- **Impact**: Percy provides better diff visualization and baseline management but adds cost ($149/month for Pro plan)
- **Recommendation**: Start with Playwright visual comparison Phase 1, upgrade to Percy if needed Phase 2 (I have paid License from https://www.browserstack.com and Have the Product Accesses: Accessibility Design Toolkit, Accessibility Testing, App Accessibility Testing, App Automate, App Live, App Percy, Automate, Automate TurboScale, Bug Capture, Website Scanner, Live, Low Code Automation, Percy, Requestly, Test Management, Test Reporting & Analytics, Testing Toolkit) (Recommendation accepted. Use all the product accesses for all types of testing in the project)
