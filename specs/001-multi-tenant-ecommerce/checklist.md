## Category: Completeness (Missing Specifications)

### Authentication & Authorization

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Define SSO integration scope** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Explicitly deferred to Phase 2 in Dependencies section. Phase 1 implements email/password authentication with MFA only. SSO integration requires additional requirements for provider configuration UI, profile mapping, JIT provisioning, and error handling.  
  *Resolution: Dependencies section clarifies SSO as Phase 2 feature with detailed rationale.*

- [x] **Define customer self-registration validation** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-148 added defining complete storefront self-registration flow with email verification (24-hour token), required/optional fields, unverified account restrictions, and manual verification option for staff.  
  *Resolution: FR-148 provides comprehensive customer registration specifications.*

- [x] **Clarify session invalidation propagation delay** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-149 added clarifying 60-second propagation acceptable for non-critical changes (profile updates) but <10 seconds required for security-critical changes (password change, permission revocation) via synchronous Vercel KV deletion.  
  *Resolution: FR-149 differentiates security-critical vs non-critical session invalidation timing.*

### Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

- [x] **Define cross-tenant user access patterns** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-140 added defining multi-store user access with UserStore join table, per-store role assignment, store switching UI in dashboard header, session context with active storeId, Super Admin privileges across all stores, and audit logging for store switches.  
  *Resolution: FR-140 provides comprehensive multi-tenancy user access specifications.*

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Specify tenant provisioning automation** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section clarifies store provisioning as Super Admin-only for Phase 1 (managed B2B model). Self-service store signup with trial activation and customer billing deferred to Phase 2 as customer acquisition feature.  
  *Resolution: Assumptions explicitly confirm admin-only provisioning with Phase 2 deferral.*

### Product Catalog & Inventory

- [x] **Define product variant limit** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines maximum 100 variants per product with UI recommendations (dropdown for ≤20 variants, modal for 20-100). Database enforces limit via check constraint. Performance note provided for products with >100 variants.  
  *Resolution: Assumption clarifies variant limit with UI and performance guidance.*

- [x] **Clarify bulk import validation behavior** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines all-or-nothing transaction rollback strategy. If any product fails validation, entire batch rejected with detailed error report (line numbers, error descriptions). Partial import deferred to Phase 2.  
  *Resolution: Assumption specifies rollback strategy with user-friendly error reporting.*

- [x] **Define inventory adjustment approval workflow** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section explicitly confirms Phase 1 has NO approval workflows; all inventory adjustments immediate upon submission by authorized staff. Approval workflows for large adjustments (>1000 units or >$10K value) deferred to Phase 2.  
  *Resolution: Assumption confirms no approvals needed for Phase 1 with enterprise deferral.*

### Orders & Payments

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Define payment authorization timeout** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-109A defines 5-minute hard timeout for payment authorization. FR-109C defines failed payment retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff). FR-109D defines 15-minute webhook reconciliation window.  
  *Resolution: FR-109A-D provide comprehensive payment timeout and retry specifications.*

- [x] **Clarify refund amount limits** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines refund ceiling: total refunds cannot exceed original payment amount. Multiple partial refunds allowed until cumulative equals order total. Service recovery overages require manual Super Admin intervention with audit log entry.  
  *Resolution: Assumption specifies refund limits with overage exception process.*

- [x] **Define COD cash collection reconciliation** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section clarifies COD available in Phase 1 but cash collection confirmation workflow deferred to Phase 2. Phase 1 treats COD as "pending" payment; requires manual admin marking as "paid" after delivery confirmation.  
  *Resolution: Assumption defers COD reconciliation to Phase 2 with Phase 1 workaround.*

### Shipping & Tax

- [x] **Define international shipping customs data** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section explicitly defers international shipping to Phase 2. Phase 1 supports domestic shipping only (no customs declarations, HS codes, international carrier integrations). Stores requiring international shipping must wait for Phase 2.  
  *Resolution: Assumption clarifies domestic-only scope with Phase 2 deferral.*

- [x] **Clarify tax calculation rounding** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines banker's rounding (round to nearest even) per ISO 4217 standard. Example: $10.125 → $10.12, $10.135 → $10.14. Ensures fairness over millions of transactions.  
  *Resolution: Assumption specifies banker's rounding with examples.*

### Subscription Plans & Limits

- [x] **Define plan downgrade data retention** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines blocking strategy: downgrade blocked until store reduces data below new limit. System displays clear error message with exact counts. No automatic data deletion or archiving. Admin must manually reduce data.  
  *Resolution: Assumption specifies block-until-under-limit strategy with user guidance.*

- [x] **Clarify trial expiration grace period UI** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines trial expiration warnings at 7, 3, and 1 days before expiration via email and in-app banner. Post-expiration: 7-day grace period with banner, then read-only mode. Detailed notification strategy provided.  
  *Resolution: Assumption provides comprehensive trial expiration notification strategy.*

### Analytics & Reporting

- [x] **Define report time zone handling** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section clarifies all reports use store's configured time zone (default: UTC). Time zone configurable in Store Settings. Timestamps include offset (e.g., "2025-01-15 14:30:00 -05:00"). Daylight saving handled automatically.  
  *Resolution: Assumption specifies store time zone with UTC default.*

- [x] **Clarify "top products" ranking algorithm** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-144 defines configurable ranking algorithm with default (revenue), alternatives (units sold, profit margin, conversion rate), tie-breaking rules, configurable time periods (7/30/90 days, custom), and display formats (top 10/20/50/100 with CSV export).  
  *Resolution: FR-144 provides comprehensive ranking specifications.*

### Email & Notifications

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Define email template preview accuracy** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-143 defines email template preview using predefined sample data (not real customer data) with clear "PREVIEW MODE" watermark. Missing variables show placeholder warnings. Optional real data preview with explicit confirmation. Test send functionality included.  
  *Resolution: FR-143 provides comprehensive preview strategy with privacy protection.*

- [x] **Clarify notification batch timing** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-142 defines intelligent bulk notification handling with threshold detection (>100 same-type in 5min), digest format, immediate vs batched classification (critical always immediate, informational batched), hourly digest frequency, and opt-out capability.  
  *Resolution: FR-142 specifies detailed batching and digest strategy.*

---

## Category: Clarity (Ambiguous Requirements)

### Technical Assumptions

- [x] **Ambiguous "responsive performance" definition** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-113 defines responsive performance with explicit cross-references to success criteria timing targets: SC-003, SC-007, SC-011, SC-012, SC-013, SC-017, SC-020, SC-021-025. Each cross-reference provides specific measurable target (e.g., product listing <2s, API response p95 <500ms).  
  *Resolution: FR-113 already includes comprehensive cross-references to measurable performance success criteria.*

- [x] **Unclear "store level" configuration scope** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-150 defines Store Admin role requirement for all threshold configurations (low stock, discount limits, refund ceilings, bulk operation batch sizes). Staff/Manager roles have read-only access. Super Admin can override. Full audit trail logs all configuration changes with permission denied UI for unauthorized users.  
  *Resolution: FR-150 specifies configuration permissions with role-based access control.*

### Multi-Tenancy

- [x] **Vague "cross-tenant isolation" enforcement** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-141 specifies Prisma middleware auto-injection of storeId for all queries with whitelist exceptions (Super Admin context), PostgreSQL RLS policies at database level for defense-in-depth, unit tests requiring manual storeId filtering to fail, E2E test scenarios verifying cross-tenant leakage blocked, and zero-tolerance policy (any cross-tenant leak is P0 bug).  
  *Resolution: FR-141 provides comprehensive technical enforcement strategy with dual-layer protection.*

### Inventory

- [x] **Inconsistent "low stock" terminology** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Assumptions section defines three inventory states with precise thresholds and visual indicators: "Out of Stock" (qty = 0, red badge, "Sold Out" label), "Low Stock" (0 < qty ≤ threshold, yellow badge, "Only X left" label), "In Stock" (qty > threshold, green badge, "Available" label). Default threshold 10 units, configurable per product.  
  *Resolution: Assumption provides clear state definitions with visual design specifications.*

### External Integrations

- [x] **Ambiguous external sync "real-time" SLA** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-100 defines webhook delivery SLA as <5 seconds from event occurrence to external system POST request initiation (does NOT include external platform response time). Timeout configuration (30s default for external response), retry mechanism (exponential backoff), and monitoring dashboard showing delivery success rate.  
  *Resolution: FR-100 clarifies 5s SLA measures internal processing only, excludes external API latency.*

- [x] **Unclear webhook "permanent failure" definition** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-137 defines permanent failure detection with explicit HTTP status codes: permanent (HTTP 410 Gone, repeated 404/403 over 3 attempts, TLS certificate errors), transient/retriable (408 timeout, 429 rate limit, 500-504 server errors). Automatic webhook disabling after 3 consecutive permanent failures with admin email notification and dashboard alert.  
  *Resolution: FR-137 provides comprehensive webhook failure classification and handling workflow.*

### Security

- [x] **Vague MFA "backup code" expiration** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-139 defines backup code lifecycle: codes never expire individually but are replaced on regeneration. User-initiated regeneration flow (requires password confirmation), old codes invalidated immediately. Warning UI displays banner when <3 unused codes remain: "Only X backup codes remaining. Generate new codes." No auto-regeneration to prevent lockout scenarios.  
  *Resolution: FR-139 provides complete backup code lifecycle with user warnings and manual renewal.*

---

## Category: Testability (Verification Challenges)

### Concurrency & Race Conditions

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Missing concurrency test scenarios for cart** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: E2E Test Scenarios section (line 550+) includes cart race condition scenarios: two users adding last item simultaneously (one succeeds, one gets "Out of stock" error), user deleting item while checkout processes (optimistic locking with version check), cart abandonment during payment authorization (30-minute timeout releases inventory). Expected outcomes defined with HTTP status codes.  
  *Resolution: E2E Test Scenarios section provides comprehensive cart concurrency test coverage.*

- [x] **Insufficient webhook idempotency test coverage** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: E2E Test Scenarios section includes webhook idempotency edge cases: same webhook received within 10ms (second blocked with HTTP 409 Conflict), idempotency key expires mid-processing (graceful degradation, process completes), Redis connection failure during key check (fallback to database-level deduplication via unique constraint on webhookId). Integration test framework uses MSW for mocking.  
  *Resolution: E2E Test Scenarios and integration test strategy cover idempotency failure modes.*

### Performance & Scalability

- [x] **Untestable "large catalog" performance claim** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: E2E Test Scenarios section requires pre-launch validation task to seed 10K products (maximum plan limit) and verify SC-007 (search <1s), SC-021 (product list <2s), SC-022 (category page <2.5s) compliance. Lighthouse CI enforces performance budgets on every PR. Load testing with k6 simulates realistic catalog sizes.  
  *Resolution: E2E Test Scenarios define pre-launch validation requirements for large catalog performance.*

- [x] **Missing load test acceptance criteria** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115F defines load test success metrics using k6 (Grafana): <1% error rate at 100 concurrent users sustained for 5 minutes, p95 latency meets all SC targets (API <500ms, dashboard <2s), throughput ≥1000 orders/hour (83K/month = ~2800/day = ~117/hour average, 10x peak capacity), zero database connection pool exhaustion.  
  *Resolution: FR-115F provides comprehensive load test acceptance criteria.*

### Error Handling

- [x] **Insufficient payment failure scenario coverage** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-109C defines payment gateway error handling for all failure modes: network timeout (30s timeout, retry with exponential backoff), invalid credentials (HTTP 401, display "Payment configuration error, contact support"), merchant account suspended (HTTP 403, same error), insufficient funds (decline code, user-friendly message "Card declined. Try another payment method"). E2E Test Scenarios use Stripe test mode cards for each scenario.  
  *Resolution: FR-109C and E2E Test Scenarios provide comprehensive payment failure coverage.*

- [x] **Missing email delivery failure verification** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-142 defines email delivery retry logic with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min, 1hr intervals), DLQ storage after 4 failed attempts, monitoring dashboard showing delivery success rate. Integration tests use MSW to mock SendGrid API failures: immediate 503 error (verify retry), prolonged outage >1 hour (verify DLQ), API returns 200 but webhook reports bounce (verify bounce handling).  
  *Resolution: FR-142 and integration test strategy cover email delivery failure scenarios.*

### Accessibility

- [x] **[BLOCKER] No WCAG 2.1 AA verification plan** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-127A defines comprehensive WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance verification: axe-core automated testing integrated in E2E tests (Playwright accessibility checks block CI on violations), manual keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Enter, Escape for all interactive elements), screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver quarterly. All violations documented in GitHub issues with P1 priority.  
  *Resolution: FR-127A provides comprehensive accessibility verification plan with automated and manual testing.*

  *Resolution: FR-147 provides comprehensive CORS policy.*

- [x] **Missing API authentication method for external sync** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-127D defines API authentication method storage: OAuth 2.0 (Shopify, BigCommerce) with refresh token, REST API key (WooCommerce, custom platforms), JWT (modern APIs). Payment Gateway Config entity stores authentication method enum, encrypted credentials, token expiration timestamp, automatic refresh flow (background job 1 hour before expiration), credential rotation policy with audit logging.  
  *Resolution: FR-127D documents supported authentication methods.*

---

## Category: Performance (Optimization Gaps)

### Database Queries

- [x] **Missing index strategy for large tables** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115B defines database optimization requirements: compound indexes on all foreign keys + frequently queried columns (storeId + createdAt, storeId + status, storeId + email), documented in data-model.md with `@@index([storeId, createdAt])` directives, select only needed fields (no SELECT * queries), pagination with cursor-based approach for large datasets, slow query monitoring (>100ms threshold logs to Vercel Analytics).  
  *Resolution: FR-115B and data-model.md provide comprehensive indexing strategy.*

- [x] **Unclear caching invalidation strategy** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115E defines event-based cache invalidation: immediate cache clear on product/category/price updates (via Redis PUBLISH to invalidate all caches), 5-minute TTL as backup (eventual consistency if event missed), cache versioning with product.updatedAt timestamp in cache key, monitoring dashboard showing cache hit rate and invalidation frequency. Prioritizes price accuracy over caching efficiency.  
  *Resolution: FR-115E provides comprehensive caching strategy with event-based invalidation.*

### Frontend Performance

- [x] **[BLOCKER] Missing image optimization requirements** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115A defines comprehensive image optimization pipeline: automatic WebP/AVIF conversion with fallback to JPEG/PNG, responsive image sizing with srcset generation (6 breakpoints: 640/768/1024/1280/1536/1920px), lazy loading with Intersection Observer API, CDN delivery via Vercel Edge Network with 1-year cache TTL, maximum upload size 10MB, automatic quality optimization (80% for JPEG), alt text required for accessibility, processing via sharp.js on upload.  
  *Resolution: FR-115A provides comprehensive image optimization specification.*

- [x] **Undefined JavaScript bundle size budget** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115C defines JavaScript bundle size budget: initial page load <200KB gzipped (blocking CI deployment if exceeded), warning at 180KB, per-route code splitting with dynamic imports for heavy components, tree-shaking enabled for all dependencies, Vercel Analytics bundle analysis on every PR deployment, Lighthouse CI performance score ≥90 required to merge. Admin dashboard target <300KB, storefront target <150KB. Next.js webpack-bundle-analyzer generates reports.  
  *Resolution: FR-115C provides comprehensive bundle size budget with CI enforcement.*

---

## Category: Accessibility (WCAG Compliance Gaps)

### Keyboard Navigation

- [x] **Missing keyboard shortcut specification** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: E2E Test Scenarios section defines keyboard shortcuts following WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices: Tab (navigate interactive elements), Enter/Space (activate buttons), Escape (close modals/dropdowns), Arrow keys (navigate within dropdowns/lists), / (focus search input), skip navigation links ("Skip to main content"). Focus trap within modal dialogs. Automated Playwright tests verify tab order matches visual layout. Custom shortcuts deferred to Phase 2.  
  *Resolution: E2E Test Scenarios define comprehensive keyboard shortcut requirements.*

### Screen Reader Support

- [x] **Insufficient ARIA landmark specification** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-127E defines semantic HTML and ARIA landmark requirements: HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) on all pages, ARIA landmarks for complex widgets (`role="navigation"`, `role="search"`, `role="alert"`), unique landmark labels when multiple same-type landmarks exist (`aria-label="Main navigation"` vs `aria-label="Footer navigation"`), verified by axe-core automated tests in CI, Playwright accessibility checks block merges on violations.  
  *Resolution: FR-127E provides comprehensive semantic HTML and ARIA landmark requirements.*

### Color Contrast

  *Resolution: FR-127A provides comprehensive color contrast verification with theme editor validation.*

---

## Category: User Experience (Usability Gaps)

### Error Messaging

- [x] **Generic error messages lacking actionability** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Multiple FRs define consistent error message pattern with three components: (1) what went wrong ("SKU 'ABC123' already exists"), (2) why it failed ("for product 'Blue T-Shirt'"), (3) how to fix ("Change SKU or edit existing product"). Validation errors show field-level inline messages with red border, network errors provide retry button, permission errors include contact information, rate limit errors show exact wait time. Never expose stack traces to users (logged to Sentry only).  
  *Resolution: Multiple FRs provide comprehensive error message patterns with actionable guidance.*

### Loading States

- [x] **Missing loading indicator requirements** - ✅ **RESOLVED**: FR-115C defines loading state patterns: skeleton screens for initial page load (product list, dashboard), inline spinners for form submissions (Save button with loading state), progress bars for long-running operations >3s (CSV import, report generation), optimistic UI updates for instant feedback (add to cart, like button), toast notifications for background operations ("Export started. We'll email you when ready."). Display loading indicator for operations exceeding 500ms, timeout after 30s with error message.  
  *Resolution: FR-115C provides comprehensive loading state feedback patterns.*

### Mobile Responsiveness
