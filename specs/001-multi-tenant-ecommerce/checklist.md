---

## Category: Completeness (Missing Specifications)

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Define SSO integration scope** - spec.md mentions "Optional SSO providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google, OneLogin)" in Assumptions but has no functional requirements or user stories defining SSO login flows, profile mapping, or error handling. US0 only covers email/password authentication.  
  *Recommendation:* Either add US0-SSO with acceptance scenarios or explicitly defer SSO to Phase 2.

- [ ] **Define customer self-registration validation** - US0 covers admin/staff account creation but customer signup validation is unclear. Does the storefront allow customer self-registration or admin-only creation? Is email verification mandatory for customers?  
  *Recommendation:* Add explicit acceptance scenario to US0 or US3a for customer account creation flow.

- [ ] **Clarify session invalidation propagation delay** - FR-047 states "Session invalidation on password change or permission revocation completes within 60 seconds across all active sessions" but implementation mechanism unclear. Is 60 seconds acceptable for security-sensitive operations like privilege escalation?  
  *Recommendation:* Specify whether 60s delay is acceptable or if immediate invalidation required (<10ms per Session entity definition using Vercel KV).

### Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

- [ ] **Define cross-tenant user access patterns** - User entity states "belongs to one or more Stores" but spec.md lacks clear requirements for users with multi-store access (e.g., franchise manager overseeing 5 stores). How does role inheritance work across stores?  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement defining multi-store user scenarios, role scoping, and store switching UI.

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Specify tenant provisioning automation** - US1 defines manual store creation by Super Admin but doesn't address self-service store creation (like Shopify's signup). Is this intentional for Phase 1?  
  *Recommendation:* Confirm whether store creation is admin-only or add self-service signup flow with trial activation.

### Product Catalog & Inventory

- [ ] **Define product variant limit** - data-model.md and spec.md don't specify maximum variants per product. This impacts UI design (dropdown vs modal selector), performance, and database constraints.  
  *Recommendation:* Add explicit limit (e.g., max 100 variants per product) or clarify unlimited support with performance implications.

- [ ] **Clarify bulk import validation behavior** - US2 mentions bulk import via CSV but doesn't define partial success handling. If 500 products uploaded and 50 fail validation, are the 450 valid ones imported or is the entire batch rolled back?  
  *Recommendation:* Add acceptance scenario for partial import failures with rollback strategy.

- [ ] **Define inventory adjustment approval workflow** - Inventory Adjustment entity tracks reason/actor but no requirements for approval gates on large adjustments (e.g., >1000 unit decrease requires manager approval).  
  *Recommendation:* Confirm if Phase 1 has any approval workflows or all adjustments are immediate.

### Orders & Payments

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Define payment authorization timeout** - SC-013 states "Payment processing (authorization) completes within 10 seconds for 95% of transactions" but doesn't specify timeout for the remaining 5%. Do they fail after 30s, 60s, or indefinitely?  
  *Recommendation:* Add explicit timeout (e.g., 30s) and fallback behavior (display error, retry, or queue for async processing).

- [ ] **Clarify refund amount limits** - Refund entity lacks validation rules. Can refund amount exceed original order total (for service recovery)? Can multiple refunds exceed order total?  
  *Recommendation:* Add business rule defining refund ceiling (≤ original payment amount or allow overages).

- [ ] **Define COD cash collection reconciliation** - Payment entity includes COD (Cash on Delivery) but no requirements for marking COD payments as "cash collected" after delivery. How does this integrate with Shipment status?  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement for COD payment confirmation workflow or defer COD to Phase 2.

### Shipping & Tax

- [ ] **Define international shipping customs data** - Shipping entity has carrier/tracking but international shipments require customs declaration (HS codes, declared value). Is this in scope?  
  *Recommendation:* Explicitly defer international shipping features to Phase 2 or add customs data requirements.

- [ ] **Clarify tax calculation rounding** - Tax Rate entity has percentage but doesn't specify rounding rules (round up, down, nearest cent, or banker's rounding). Different methods cause ±1¢ discrepancies.  
  *Recommendation:* Add business rule specifying rounding method (recommend banker's rounding for fairness).

### Subscription Plans & Limits

- [ ] **Define plan downgrade data retention** - FR-065 covers plan downgrade but doesn't specify what happens to data exceeding new limits (e.g., downgrade from Pro [1000 products] to Basic [100 products] when store has 500 products).  
  *Recommendation:* Add explicit rules: block downgrade until under limit, archive excess data, or delete oldest items.

- [ ] **Clarify trial expiration grace period UI** - Assumptions mention 7-day grace period after plan expiration but no requirements for in-app warnings during trial/grace period (e.g., banner, modal, email countdown).  
  *Recommendation:* Add notification requirements for 7/3/1 days before trial expiration.

### Analytics & Reporting

- [ ] **Define report time zone handling** - Dashboard metrics use server time per Assumptions but stores may operate in different time zones. Do reports show UTC or store local time? What about daylight saving transitions?  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement specifying report time zone preference (default to store setting or UTC with conversion).

- [ ] **Clarify "top products" ranking algorithm** - US7 mentions analytics KPIs but doesn't define how "top products" are ranked (revenue, units sold, profit margin, or weighted score).  
  *Recommendation:* Document ranking formula or allow store-configurable ranking.

### Email & Notifications

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Define email template preview accuracy** - FR-076 requires preview but doesn't specify data source for template variables. Does preview use real data (last order) or sample data? How to handle missing variables (e.g., no tracking number yet)?  
  *Recommendation:* Specify preview data strategy (sample values vs real data) and placeholder handling.

- [ ] **Clarify notification batch timing** - FR-077 states "queued and sent within 5 minutes" but doesn't specify batching strategy for bulk events (e.g., 100 low-stock alerts triggered simultaneously). Are they sent individually or in digest format?  
  *Recommendation:* Add business rule for bulk notification handling (immediate individual sends vs daily digest).

---

## Category: Clarity (Ambiguous Requirements)

### Technical Assumptions

- [ ] **Ambiguous "responsive performance" definition** - FR-113 references "responsive performance" but definition varies by context (page load vs API response vs UI interaction latency). Success Criteria provide specific targets but FR-113 should cross-reference them.  
  *Recommendation:* Replace "responsive performance" with explicit cross-references to SC-003, SC-007, SC-011, SC-012, SC-021-025.

- [ ] **Unclear "store level" configuration scope** - FR-110 allows "store level" threshold configuration but doesn't specify if individual staff users can override thresholds or only Store Admins.  
  *Recommendation:* Clarify permission level required to modify thresholds (Store Admin only vs configurable per role).

### Multi-Tenancy

- [ ] **Vague "cross-tenant isolation" enforcement** - Technical Assumptions mention "Row-Level Security (RLS) with storeId foreign key" but doesn't specify whether implemented via database RLS policies (PostgreSQL native), Prisma middleware (application layer), or both.  
  *Recommendation:* Specify isolation enforcement mechanism: Prisma middleware for auto-injection (preferred for SQLite dev compatibility) or PostgreSQL RLS policies (production only).

### Inventory

- [ ] **Inconsistent "low stock" terminology** - spec.md uses "low stock", "out of stock", "stockout" interchangeably. Are these distinct states (low = below threshold, out = zero) or synonyms?  
  *Recommendation:* Define precise inventory states: `IN_STOCK` (qty > threshold), `LOW_STOCK` (0 < qty ≤ threshold), `OUT_OF_STOCK` (qty = 0), `DISCONTINUED`.

### External Integrations

- [ ] **Ambiguous external sync "real-time" SLA** - FR-100 defines "real-time sync" as <5 seconds but doesn't clarify if this includes external platform response time or only internal processing. If Shopify API takes 3s to respond, does sync still meet <5s target?  
  *Recommendation:* Specify whether 5s latency includes external API calls or is measured from webhook receipt to StormCom database update.

- [ ] **Unclear webhook "permanent failure" definition** - FR-102 mentions "permanent failures" sent to DLQ but doesn't define what constitutes permanent vs transient failure (e.g., is HTTP 404 permanent while 503 is transient?).  
  *Recommendation:* Add explicit list of permanent HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 410) vs retriable codes (408, 429, 500-504).

### Security

- [ ] **Vague MFA "backup code" expiration** - MFA Secret entity includes backup code expiration (1 year) but doesn't specify behavior at expiration: auto-regenerate, notify user, or block login?  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement for backup code lifecycle (email renewal reminder at 11 months, force regeneration at expiration).

---

## Category: Testability (Verification Challenges)

### Concurrency & Race Conditions

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Missing concurrency test scenarios for cart** - US3 has inventory concurrency test but no equivalent for cart conflicts (e.g., two users adding last item to cart simultaneously, or user deleting item while checkout processes).  
  *Recommendation:* Add E2E test scenario for cart race conditions with expected outcomes.

- [ ] **Insufficient webhook idempotency test coverage** - FR-10Y defines idempotency keys but test scenarios don't cover edge cases: same webhook received 10ms apart (within Redis latency), key expires mid-processing, or Redis connection failure during key check.  
  *Recommendation:* Add integration test scenarios for idempotency failure modes.

### Performance & Scalability

- [ ] **Untestable "large catalog" performance claim** - SC-007 states "for typical datasets (≤10K products)" but no requirements for performance testing with 10K products before launch. How to validate without production-scale data?  
  *Recommendation:* Add pre-launch validation task to seed 10K products and verify SC-007, SC-021, SC-022 compliance.

- [ ] **Missing load test acceptance criteria** - FR-113 requires "83K orders/month sustained load" but no definition of load test pass/fail criteria (error rate threshold, p95 latency, throughput).  
  *Recommendation:* Add NFR defining load test success metrics (e.g., <1% error rate, p95 latency meets SC targets, throughput ≥1000 orders/hour).

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Insufficient payment failure scenario coverage** - US4 covers payment capture but limited coverage of gateway failure modes (network timeout, invalid credentials, merchant account suspended, insufficient funds). These are common production scenarios.  
  *Recommendation:* Add E2E test scenarios for each payment gateway error type with expected user messaging.

- [ ] **Missing email delivery failure verification** - FR-077 requires retry logic but no test scenarios verifying retry behavior or DLQ handling (e.g., SendGrid API down for 1 hour, does system recover?).  
  *Recommendation:* Add integration test with mocked SMTP failure to verify exponential backoff and DLQ storage.

### Accessibility

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] No WCAG 2.1 AA verification plan** - SC-027 requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance but no requirements for automated testing (axe-core) or manual audit process. How to verify compliance before launch?  
  *Recommendation:* Add testing requirement: run axe-core in E2E tests (block CI on violations) + manual audit with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS) before GA.

---

## Category: Security (Vulnerability Gaps)

### Authentication

- [ ] **Missing rate limit for password reset** - FR-045 has rate limiting for login (20 attempts/5min) but password reset endpoint lacks rate limit. Vulnerable to email bombing attacks (attacker triggers 1000 reset emails to victim).  
  *Recommendation:* Add rate limit to password reset: 5 requests per email per 15 minutes, 20 requests per IP per 5 minutes.

- [ ] **Weak MFA recovery token lifetime** - MFA Recovery Token has 1-hour expiration but no mention of single-use enforcement or rate limiting. Can attacker brute-force recovery token?  
  *Recommendation:* Verify recovery token is single-use (add `used` flag) and rate-limited (3 attempts per user per hour).

### Data Protection

- [ ] **Insufficient encryption specification for sensitive fields** - Payment Gateway Config stores "credentials (encrypted)" but doesn't specify encryption algorithm (AES-256-GCM recommended), key rotation policy, or key storage (KMS vs env var).  
  *Recommendation:* Add security requirement specifying encryption standard: AES-256-GCM with DEK (Data Encryption Key) stored in Vercel environment variables, rotated every 90 days.

- [ ] **Missing audit log tamper protection** - FR-122 requires "immutable storage" for audit logs but implementation unclear. Does "immutable" mean append-only table with no UPDATE/DELETE grants, or cryptographic verification (hash chain)?  
  *Recommendation:* Specify immutability mechanism: Prisma model without update/delete methods + database trigger blocking modifications + periodic hash verification.

### API Security

- [ ] **Incomplete CORS policy definition** - Technical Assumptions mention "CORS protection" but no specification of allowed origins. Does storefront domain auto-whitelist, or must Store Admin manually configure allowed origins?  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement for CORS configuration: auto-allow `{store.domain}` and `*.{store.domain}`, provide UI for additional origins.

- [ ] **Missing API authentication method for external sync** - External Platform Integration entity stores "API credentials (encrypted)" but spec.md doesn't specify authentication method (OAuth 2.0, API key, JWT). Different platforms use different methods.  
  *Recommendation:* Document supported auth methods per platform (Shopify: OAuth 2.0, WooCommerce: REST API key) and credential storage structure.

---

## Category: Performance (Optimization Gaps)

### Database Queries

- [ ] **Missing index strategy for large tables** - data-model.md defines 30+ entities but doesn't specify composite indexes for common queries (e.g., `Order.storeId + Order.createdAt` for dashboard reports, `Product.storeId + Product.slug` for storefront).  
  *Recommendation:* Add indexing plan to data-model.md: all foreign keys + storeId, common filter combinations, full-text search fields.

- [ ] **Unclear caching invalidation strategy** - FR-115 mentions "Redis-based caching for product lists/categories with 5-minute TTL" but doesn't specify invalidation on product update. Stale cache could show wrong prices for up to 5 minutes.  
  *Recommendation:* Clarify caching strategy: time-based expiration (5min TTL) OR event-based invalidation (immediate cache clear on product update). Recommend event-based for price accuracy.

### Frontend Performance

- [ ] **[BLOCKER] Missing image optimization requirements** - SC-024 requires lazy loading and WebP format but no specification for image processing pipeline (on-upload resize, CDN transformation, responsive srcset generation).  
  *Recommendation:* Add functional requirement for image optimization: resize uploads to 2000px max width, generate 3 sizes (thumbnail 200px, medium 600px, large 1200px), store in CDN with WebP auto-conversion.

- [ ] **Undefined JavaScript bundle size budget** - Technical Assumptions target "<200KB initial bundle" but no breakdown by route or enforcement mechanism. Hard to validate during development.  
  *Recommendation:* Add CI check: Next.js bundle analysis reports per PR, block merge if main bundle exceeds 200KB (excluding vendor chunks).

---

## Category: Accessibility (WCAG Compliance Gaps)

### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] **Missing keyboard shortcut specification** - SC-027 requires keyboard navigation but spec.md doesn't define keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., / to focus search, Esc to close modals, arrow keys for product image carousel).  
  *Recommendation:* Add UX requirement documenting standard keyboard shortcuts (follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices) or defer custom shortcuts to Phase 2.

### Screen Reader Support

- [ ] **Insufficient ARIA landmark specification** - spec.md mentions "ARIA labels" but doesn't require semantic HTML landmarks (header, nav, main, aside, footer). Critical for screen reader navigation.  
  *Recommendation:* Add accessibility requirement: all pages use HTML5 semantic elements + ARIA landmarks, verified by axe-core automated tests.

### Color Contrast

- [ ] **No color palette contrast verification** - Design system mentions "Inter font, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance" but no requirement for color palette contrast checking during theme customization. Store Admin could choose failing color combinations.  
  *Recommendation:* Add theme editor validation: block saving themes with contrast ratio <4.5:1 for text, <3:1 for UI components. Display contrast ratio in color picker.

---

## Category: User Experience (Usability Gaps)

### Error Messaging

- [ ] **Generic error messages lacking actionability** - FR-112 requires "human-readable error messages" but examples are unclear. What does "SKU already exists" tell user to do? Change SKU, view conflicting product, or ignore?  
  *Recommendation:* Add UX guideline for error messages: always include (1) what went wrong, (2) why it failed, (3) how to fix. Example: "SKU 'ABC123' already exists for product 'Blue T-Shirt'. Change SKU or edit existing product."

### Loading States

- [ ] **Missing loading indicator requirements** - Success Criteria define response time targets but no requirements for loading indicators during async operations (e.g., spinner, skeleton UI, progress bar). Users perceive same 2s differently with vs without feedback.  
  *Recommendation:* Add UX requirement: display loading indicators for operations exceeding 500ms, use skeleton UI for list views (products, orders), show progress bars for bulk operations (import, export).

### Mobile Responsiveness

- [ ] **Undefined mobile breakpoints** - Design system uses Tailwind CSS but doesn't specify breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop layouts. Inconsistent responsive behavior possible.  
  *Recommendation:* Document standard breakpoints in design system: mobile <640px, tablet 640-1024px, desktop >1024px. All pages must render usably at 375px width (iPhone SE).

## Next Steps

### Before Implementation Begins

1. **Resolve Critical Blockers (8 items)** marked with `[BLOCKER]` tag - these prevent coding from starting.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities** - schedule requirements refinement session with stakeholders for items marked "unclear" or "ambiguous".
3. **Update spec.md** - incorporate resolutions from this checklist into specification.
4. **Create Test Plan** - map success criteria (SC-001 through SC-034) to specific test scenarios.

### After Checklist Complete

1. **Run /speckit.tasks** - generate task breakdown (creates tasks.md) now that requirements are validated.
2. **Run /speckit.analyze** - cross-artifact consistency check after tasks.md exists.
3. **Begin Phase 0 Implementation** - start coding with confidence in specification quality.
