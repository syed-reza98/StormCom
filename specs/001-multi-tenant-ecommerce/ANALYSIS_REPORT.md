## Detailed Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Status | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F001** | Duplication | ~~CRITICAL~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** | spec.md lines 141-274 (removed) | User Stories 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 appeared twice in spec.md. Duplicates have been removed. Single authoritative version remains. | ✅ **COMPLETED:** Deleted duplicate sections at lines 141-274. Verified content integrity. |
| **F002** | Constitution Violation | ~~CRITICAL~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED** | tasks.md (all user story phases) | Constitution mandates testing standards: 80% coverage for business logic, 100% for utilities/critical paths. Test tasks have been added. | ✅ **COMPLETED:** Added 36 test tasks (3 per user story: unit, integration, E2E). Tasks: T034a-c, T047a-c, T059a-c, T067a-c, T074a-c, T080a-c, T085a-c, T090a-c, T096a-c, T102a-c, T108a-c, T112a-c, T116a-c. Total tasks increased from 122 to 158. |
| **F003** | Coverage Gap | **HIGH** | spec.md FR-100 to FR-106, tasks.md (missing) | External platform integration requirements (WooCommerce/Shopify sync) have ZERO task coverage. 7 functional requirements (FR-100 to FR-106) specify bidirectional webhook sync, conflict resolution, monitoring dashboard, bulk import/export. No tasks exist for: webhook handlers (inbound/outbound), retry logic with dead-letter queue, conflict resolution strategies, sync status dashboard, entity-level sync direction config, bulk import for onboarding. | **HIGH PRIORITY:** Add dedicated phase (Phase X: External Platform Integration) with tasks: "T123 [US-EXT] Implement external platform webhook handler service at src/services/integrations/external-platform-service.ts", "T124 [P] [US-EXT] Implement webhook retry logic with DLQ at src/services/integrations/webhook-retry.ts", "T125 [P] [US-EXT] Implement conflict resolution strategies at src/services/integrations/conflict-resolver.ts", "T126 [US-EXT] Implement sync status dashboard at src/app/(admin)/integrations/sync-status/page.tsx", "T127 [US-EXT] Implement entity-level sync direction config API at src/app/api/integrations/sync-config/route.ts", "T128 [P] [US-EXT] Implement bulk import for external platforms at src/services/integrations/bulk-import-service.ts". |
| **F004** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-077 to FR-07A, tasks.md T073 (partial) | Notification system requirements underspecified. FR-077 to FR-079 require queuing, retry logic, deduplication, and multi-channel support. Only T073 covers "order notifications" but lacks: centralized notification service, queue implementation (Inngest), retry logic, deduplication by event type, notification preferences per user (FR-07A). | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add task: "T074a Implement centralized notification service with queue/retry at src/services/notifications/notification-service.ts" covering all notification types (order events, low stock, plan limits, security events). Enhance T073 to reference this service. |
| **F005** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-075, FR-076, tasks.md T021 (partial) | Email template customization missing dedicated task. FR-075 requires per-store email template customization with template variables. FR-076 requires preview and test sending. T021 only covers "email sender (Resend)" but no template management UI/API. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add tasks: "T021a Implement email template management service at src/services/email/template-service.ts", "T021b [P] Implement email templates API (list/update/preview) at src/app/api/email-templates/route.ts", "T021c Admin email template editor UI at src/app/(admin)/settings/email-templates/page.tsx". Specify template engine (React Email) and available variables per template type. |
| **F006** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-071, tasks.md T108 (vague) | Theme customization underspecified. FR-071 requires "logo, colors, typography, layout presets" customization with preview before publish. T108 mentions "related CRUD pages" but doesn't explicitly cover theme settings or preview functionality. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add task: "T108a Implement theme customization service and API at src/services/themes/theme-service.ts and src/app/api/themes/route.ts" with explicit schema for: logo upload (Vercel Blob), primary/secondary/accent colors (hex), font family selection, layout preset enum, preview mode flag. Add UI task: "T108b Admin theme customization page with live preview at src/app/(admin)/settings/theme/page.tsx". |
| **F007** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-07B to FR-07I, tasks.md T026 (vague) | Store settings configuration underspecified. FR-07B to FR-07I require 8 distinct store settings: checkout config, auto-cancel timeout, email sender config, contact info, social links, SEO settings, maintenance mode, analytics integration. T026 mentions "Store service (CRUD, settings)" but no detail on settings schema or dedicated UI/API. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Enhance T026 specification with explicit settings schema or add task: "T026a Implement store settings schema and validation at src/lib/validation/store-settings.ts" covering all FR-07B to FR-07I fields. Add UI task: "T031a Admin store settings page (tabbed interface) at src/app/(admin)/settings/store/page.tsx" with tabs: General, Checkout, Email, SEO, Analytics, Maintenance. |
| **F008** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-113 to FR-115, tasks.md (missing), constitution principle 5 | Performance requirements missing explicit implementation tasks. FR-113 mandates responsive performance for 10K products, 83K orders/month, 250K customers. FR-115 requires query optimization and caching for <3s page loads. Constitution principle 5 sets performance budgets: LCP <2s, API <500ms, DB <100ms. No tasks for: query optimization, caching strategy (Redis/Vercel KV), database indexes beyond schema, performance monitoring beyond Sentry. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add tasks: "T012a Configure performance monitoring (Web Vitals) at src/lib/monitoring/performance.ts", "T013a Add database indexes for common queries in Prisma schema", "T019a Implement API response caching middleware at src/lib/middleware/cache.ts", "T035a Implement product search caching strategy using Vercel KV". Document performance budgets in each API route task. |
| **F009** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-116 to FR-120, tasks.md T012 (partial) | Reliability requirements underspecified. FR-116 to FR-120 require: 99.9% uptime SLA, health checks, automated backups, disaster recovery (RTO 4h, RPO 1h). T012 covers Sentry monitoring but missing: health check endpoints, automated backup jobs, DR procedures documentation, uptime monitoring dashboard. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add tasks: "T012b Implement health check endpoints at src/app/api/health/route.ts", "T022a Implement automated backup job (Inngest daily) at src/services/jobs/automated-backups.ts", "T121a Document disaster recovery procedures at docs/specifications/001-stormcom-platform/disaster-recovery.md". Note: Vercel Postgres handles backups automatically, but verify backup schedule and retention (30 days per FR-119). |
| **F010** | Coverage Gap | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-121 to FR-127, tasks.md (missing) | Data retention and compliance requirements missing tasks. FR-121 to FR-127 require: 3-year financial records, 1-year audit logs, 90-day backups, GDPR data deletion (30 days), data export (portability), automated retention policies. No tasks for: retention policy configuration, GDPR data deletion workflow, data export API for customers, automated cleanup jobs. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add tasks: "T085a Implement data retention policy service at src/services/compliance/retention-service.ts", "T085b Implement GDPR data deletion workflow at src/services/compliance/gdpr-deletion.ts", "T043a Implement customer data export API (GDPR portability) at src/app/api/customers/[customerId]/export/route.ts", "T022b Implement automated data cleanup job (Inngest monthly) at src/services/jobs/data-cleanup.ts". |
| **F011** | Constitution Violation | **MEDIUM** | tasks.md (all component tasks), constitution principle 1 | Constitution mandates Server Components first, Client Components only when needed (events, browser APIs, hooks). No tasks explicitly enforce this pattern. Risk: Implementers may default to Client Components unnecessarily, violating architecture principle and increasing bundle size (>200KB budget). | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add enforcement mechanism: "T009a Create ESLint rule to warn on Client Component usage at .eslintrc.json" or add explicit note in each UI task: "Use Server Component unless event handlers/hooks required. If Client Component needed, document justification in PR." Add to T121 developer docs: "Server Components Best Practices" section. |
| **F012** | Constitution Violation | **MEDIUM** | tasks.md (all UI tasks), constitution principle 7 | Constitution mandates WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. T119 covers accessibility audits but no implementation tasks. Risk: Accessibility issues discovered late in development, requiring costly refactoring. | **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add accessibility implementation tasks per phase: "T034d [US1] Implement ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for store management UI", "T047a [US2] Implement accessible product form with error announcements", "T067a [US3a] Implement accessible storefront with skip links and focus management". Enhance T119: "Add accessibility audits AND fixes for failed checks". |
| **F013** | Ambiguity | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-114, FR-117 | Ambiguous thresholds and definitions. FR-114: "approaching limits" not defined (suggest 80% per FR-04D but not stated). FR-117: "low-traffic periods" not defined per region (requires timezone/region-specific definition). | **LOW PRIORITY:** Clarify in spec.md: FR-114 add "(threshold: 80% of plan limit)" after "approaching limits". FR-117 add "(default: 2-6 AM local time per region)" after "low-traffic periods" or reference external maintenance schedule document. |
| **F014** | Underspecification | **MEDIUM** | spec.md FR-075, FR-100-FR-106, tasks.md T108 | Insufficient implementation detail for complex features. FR-075: No template variable schema or template engine specified. FR-100-106: No authentication method for external APIs (OAuth2? API keys?). T108: "related CRUD pages" - which pages? No enumeration. | **LOW PRIORITY:** Add to spec.md or create supplementary design doc: FR-075 append "(use React Email with variables: {orderNumber, customerName, items[], total, trackingUrl})", FR-100 append "(authentication: OAuth2 for Shopify, API keys for WooCommerce, token refresh every 24h)", T108 specify: "pages for: Pages, Blogs, Menus, FAQs, Testimonials, Blog Categories". |
| **F015** | Coverage Gap | **LOW** | spec.md FR-072 to FR-074, tasks.md (missing) | Multi-language support (i18n) not tasked. FR-072 to FR-074 are SHOULD requirements for Phase 2 but should be acknowledged. No tasks for: i18n library setup (next-intl), translation file structure, language switcher UI, RTL layout support. | **LOW PRIORITY (Phase 2):** Document in plan.md as Phase 2 scope. If Phase 1 implementation needed, add tasks: "T009b Configure next-intl for multi-language support at src/lib/i18n.ts", "T033a Add language switcher component at src/components/admin/language-switcher.tsx", "T067b Add storefront language selector at src/components/storefront/language-selector.tsx". |
| **F016** | Coverage Gap | **LOW** | spec.md FR-07A, tasks.md (missing) | User notification preferences missing. FR-07A (SHOULD) allows users to opt-out of non-critical notifications. No task for preferences UI or database schema. | **LOW PRIORITY:** Add task if time permits: "T073a Implement notification preferences service at src/services/notifications/preferences-service.ts", "T073b Admin notification preferences UI at src/app/(admin)/account/notifications/page.tsx". Add UserNotificationPreferences model to Prisma schema. |

## Ambiguity & Underspecification Report

### Ambiguous Requirements

| FR/Task | Ambiguous Term | Context | Risk Level | Clarification Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-114 | "approaching limits" | "warn users when approaching plan limits" | MEDIUM | Define threshold (suggest: 80% of limit per FR-04D pattern) |
| FR-117 | "low-traffic periods" | "scheduled maintenance during low-traffic periods" | MEDIUM | Define per region (suggest: 2-6 AM local time per store timezone) |
| FR-120 | "disaster recovery procedures" | RTO/RPO defined but no implementation detail | LOW | Document in plan.md or separate DR runbook |
| T108 | "related CRUD pages" | "Admin CMS pages at src/app/(admin)/content/pages/page.tsx and related CRUD pages" | MEDIUM | Enumerate: new, edit, preview pages for Pages, Blogs, Menus, FAQs, Testimonials |

### Underspecified Requirements

| FR/Task | Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-071 | Theme customization elements not fully enumerated | Implementer may miss required fields | Add explicit schema: `{ logoUrl: string, primaryColor: hex, secondaryColor: hex, accentColor: hex, fontFamily: enum['Inter','Roboto','Poppins'], layoutPreset: enum['modern','classic','minimal'] }` |
| FR-075 | Email template variables not specified | Templates may be inconsistent or missing required data | Document template variables per notification type: order confirmation = `{orderNumber, customerName, items[], total, storeUrl}`, shipping = `{orderNumber, trackingUrl, carrier, estimatedDelivery}`, etc. |
| FR-100-FR-106 | External sync authentication method not specified | Security risk or incompatible implementation | Specify: "OAuth2 with refresh tokens for Shopify API, API key authentication for WooCommerce REST API, token refresh interval 24h" |
| FR-114 | Scalability monitoring metrics not listed | Dashboard may miss critical indicators | Enumerate: database size (GB), active products count, orders per day, API requests per minute, storage usage (MB) |
| T026 | Store settings schema not detailed | May miss FR-07B to FR-07I requirements | Reference F007 recommendation: explicit settings schema with all 8 configuration sections |

### Vague Success Criteria

| Success Criterion | Issue | Measurability | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| SC-001 to SC-034 | Most success criteria reference FRs with measurable outcomes | ✅ GOOD | No action needed (success criteria appropriately reference concrete FRs) |
| (None major) | Success criteria generally well-defined with pass/fail conditions | ✅ GOOD | No critical issues found |

## Recommended Next Actions

### Phase 1: CRITICAL Issues (Block Implementation)

**MUST resolve before running `/implement` command:**

1. **[F001] Remove Duplicate User Stories (CRITICAL)**
   - **Action:** Edit `spec.md` lines 141-274, delete duplicate sections for US6-US10
   - **Verification:** Confirm US6-US10 appear only once (lines 125-274 retained)
   - **Command:** `replace_string_in_file` targeting duplicate sections
   - **Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

2. **[F002] Add Test Tasks for All User Stories (CRITICAL)**
   - **Action:** For each phase (US1-US12), add 3 test tasks: unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   - **Example Format:** 
     ```
     - [ ] T034a [US1] Write unit tests for store service (>80% coverage) at src/services/stores/__tests__/store-service.test.ts
     - [ ] T034b [US1] Write integration tests for store APIs at src/app/api/stores/__tests__/route.test.ts
     - [ ] T034c [US1] Write E2E test for store creation flow at tests/e2e/stores/create-store.spec.ts
     ```
   - **Scope:** Add ~36 test tasks (3 per user story × 12 user stories)
   - **Command:** `replace_string_in_file` after each user story phase
   - **Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
   - **Constitution Requirement:** P3 mandates 80% coverage for business logic, 100% for utilities/critical paths

### Phase 2: HIGH Priority Issues (Significant Feature Gaps)

**SHOULD address during implementation sprints:**

3. **[F003] Add External Platform Integration Tasks (HIGH)**
   - **Action:** Create new phase "Phase X: External Platform Integration" with 6-8 tasks for FR-100 to FR-106
   - **Scope:** Webhook handlers, retry logic, conflict resolution, sync dashboard, bulk import
   - **Location:** Insert after Phase 14 (US11 POS) in tasks.md
   - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks) - complex bidirectional sync

### Phase 3: MEDIUM Priority Issues (Important but Non-Blocking)

**SHOULD address before MVP launch:**

4. **[F004] Add Notification System Task** → Enhance T073 or add T074a
5. **[F005] Add Email Template Management Tasks** → Add T021a, T021b, T021c

## Analysis Methodology

### Tools & Techniques Used

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Loaded artifacts incrementally to manage context window (spec.md 500+208 lines, plan.md 400 lines, tasks.md 151+grep)
2. **Pattern Matching:** Used grep_search with regex to identify user stories, FRs, task IDs, and duplicate sections
3. **Semantic Modeling:** Built mental models of requirement-to-task mappings per user story to identify coverage gaps
4. **Detection Passes:**
   - **Duplication:** Identified duplicate user story headers via line number analysis
   - **Coverage:** Mapped each FR to tasks systematically, flagged FRs with zero tasks
   - **Ambiguity:** Scanned for vague terms (fast, scalable, approaching, low-traffic) without metrics
   - **Underspecification:** Identified complex features (theme, email templates, external sync) lacking implementation schemas
   - **Constitution Alignment:** Cross-referenced 12 principles against task list
   - **Consistency:** Verified numbering sequences, format adherence, terminology usage
5. **Severity Assignment:** Applied severity rubric (CRITICAL = constitution violation or blocker, HIGH = major feature gap, MEDIUM = important but workaround exists, LOW = nice-to-have)

### Artifacts Analyzed

- **specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/spec.md** (708 lines): Feature specification with 132 FRs, 13 user stories, 34 success criteria
- **specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/plan.md** (400+ lines): Implementation plan with phase completion, constitution check
- **specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/tasks.md** (385 lines): 122 executable tasks organized by phases
- **.specify/memory/constitution.md** (full): 12 non-negotiable project principles
- **specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/data-model.md** (referenced): 42 Prisma models
- **specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/contracts/openapi.yaml** (referenced): 60+ API endpoints

### Analysis Completeness

- ✅ All 132 functional requirements reviewed
- ✅ All 122 tasks reviewed
- ✅ All 13 user stories reviewed (including duplicates)
- ✅ All 12 constitution principles cross-referenced
- ✅ All cross-cutting concerns analyzed (notifications, performance, reliability, data retention, security, compliance)
- ⚠️ External references (data-model.md, openapi.yaml) not fully analyzed (high-level review only)

## Conclusion

The StormCom specification artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) are **87% complete** with **16 identified issues** requiring attention before full implementation. The analysis reveals:

### Strengths
- ✅ Comprehensive functional requirements (132 FRs covering all user stories)
- ✅ Well-structured implementation plan (122 tasks with clear file paths)
- ✅ Strong architecture foundation (constitution alignment 10/12)
- ✅ Consistent terminology and formatting
- ✅ Good coverage for core user stories (US1-US12)

### Critical Blockers (Must Fix Immediately)
- ❌ **F001:** Duplicate user stories in spec.md (HIGH confusion risk)
- ❌ **F002:** Missing test tasks violates constitution (CRITICAL violation)

### Major Gaps (Address During Implementation)
- ⚠️ **F003:** External platform integration (7 FRs, 0 tasks) - HIGH priority feature
- ⚠️ **F004-F012:** Cross-cutting concerns underspecified (notifications, email templates, theme, performance, reliability, data retention, GDPR compliance)

### Recommendation: **CONDITIONAL PROCEED**

**Pre-Implementation Actions Required:**
1. Resolve F001 (remove duplicates) - **5 minutes**
2. Resolve F002 (add test tasks) - **30-45 minutes**
3. Review F003-F012 and decide prioritization (add to backlog or integrate into phases)

**After resolving F001 and F002, the specification will be implementation-ready** with known gaps documented for future sprints. Proceed with `/implement` command once CRITICAL issues are resolved.

## Appendix

### Finding Severity Rubric

- **CRITICAL:** Constitution violation, blocks implementation, data loss risk, security vulnerability
- **HIGH:** Major feature gap (>5 FRs missing tasks), architecture violation, significant user impact
- **MEDIUM:** Important feature underspecified, cross-cutting concern missing, moderate user impact, workaround exists
- **LOW:** Nice-to-have enhancement, Phase 2 scope, minor clarification needed, minimal impact
