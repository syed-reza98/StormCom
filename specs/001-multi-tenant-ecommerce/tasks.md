## Implementation Strategy

**Approach**: MVP-first with incremental delivery by user story  
**MVP Scope**: US0 ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí US3a ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 (complete e-commerce loop)  
**Testing**: E2E tests included per spec.md scenarios (Playwright with POM)  
**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

**Key Principles**:
- Each user story phase delivers complete, independently testable functionality
- Tasks follow strict format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] marker indicates parallelizable tasks (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] labels (US0, US1, etc.) only for user story phases
- Setup and Foundational phases have NO story labels
- Dependencies clearly marked for sequential execution

## Phase 3: US0 - Authentication and Authorization (P0 - Blocking) üöß

**User Story**: As a Super Admin, Store Admin, Staff member, or Customer, I need to authenticate securely with my credentials to access the appropriate areas of the system based on my role.

**Why P0**: Authentication is the entry point to the entire system. Without secure login, no user can access any functionality. This blocks all other features.

## Phase 4: US1 - Store Management (P1 - Must Have) ‚úÖ

**User Story**: As a Super Admin, I need to create, configure, and manage multiple stores to enable multi-tenancy for my e-commerce platform.

**Why P1**: Store is the core tenant entity. Without stores, users cannot create products, take orders, or perform any business operations. This is the foundation of multi-tenancy.

**Status**: COMPLETE (All 16 tasks finished)

## Phase 5: US2 - Product Catalog (P1 - Must Have)

**User Story**: As a Store Admin, I need to create, organize, and manage my product catalog with categories, brands, and attributes to enable customers to browse and purchase products.

**Why P1**: Products are the core business entity. Without a product catalog, there is nothing to sell. This is essential for basic e-commerce functionality.

**Dependencies**: **[RESOLVED: T096]** - Phase 5 UNBLOCKED as US1 Store Management complete (stores exist, can create products).

## Phase 6: US6 - Inventory Management (P1 - Must Have)

**User Story**: As a Store Admin, I need to track product stock levels, receive low stock alerts, and manage inventory across multiple warehouses to prevent overselling and maintain accurate inventory.

**Why P1**: Inventory management prevents overselling and ensures accurate stock levels. Without this, customers could purchase out-of-stock items, leading to fulfillment failures and poor customer experience.

**Depends On**: US2 (Products must exist before inventory can be tracked)

**Independent Test**: Set product stock to 5 units. Place order for 3 units. Verify stock decreases to 2. Set low stock threshold to 3. Verify low stock alert appears. Add stock from warehouse. Verify stock increases.

**Tasks**:

    - Phase 16: US14 GDPR (T194-T201) - Depends on US0 + US1
11. **P2 Stories** (Can be completed anytime after core features):
    - Phase 17: US10 Notifications (T202-T208) - Depends on US4 + US6
    - Phase 18: US13 External Integrations (T209-T215) - Depends on US2 + US4
12. **Phase 19**: Polish (T216-T225) - Final improvements

**Critical Path (MVP)**:
Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US0 ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí US3a ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4

## Parallel Execution Examples

Tasks marked with `[P]` can be executed in parallel with other `[P]` tasks within the same phase or across phases at the same dependency level.

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)** - All tasks T024-T035 can be parallelized:
- Security middleware (T026, T027, T028)
- Utilities (T024, T025, T029, T030, T031)
- UI components (T032, T033, T034, T035)

**Within Phase 3 (US0 Authentication)** - All API routes (T040-T047) and UI pages (T048-T052) can be parallelized.

**Within Phase 5 (US2 Product Catalog)** - All API routes (T082-T094) and UI pages (T095-T102) can be parallelized.

**Across Phases (Parallel Group A)** - After US0 + US1 complete:
- US5, US8, US9, US11, US12 can all be worked on simultaneously by different team members

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 239 (updated from 225 after adding missing E2E tests)
**Phases**: 19 (Setup, Foundational, 13 User Stories, Polish)
**User Stories**: 15 (US0-US14 mapped)
**P0 (Blocking)**: 1 story (US0 - 39 tasks, including 19 E2E tests)
**P1 (Must Have)**: 12 stories (US1-US9, US11-US12, US14 - ~170 tasks)
**P2 (Should Have)**: 2 stories (US10, US13 - ~14 tasks)
**Setup & Polish**: ~30 tasks

**Format Validation**:
- ‚úÖ All tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- ‚úÖ [Story] labels only on user story tasks (not Setup, Foundational, or Polish)
- ‚úÖ [P] markers only on parallelizable tasks (different files, no dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Every task includes exact file path for implementation
- ‚úÖ E2E tests included per spec.md scenarios (UPDATED: 14 additional E2E tests added for US0)
- ‚úÖ Tasks organized by user story (PRIMARY), not technical layer
- ‚úÖ Each story phase independently testable

**Testing Coverage**:
- Unit/Integration tests: ~25 test files
- E2E tests: ~44 test scenarios (updated from ~30 after adding US0 coverage)
- Coverage targets: 80%+ for business logic, 100% for critical paths

**Estimated Implementation Time** (based on 2-hour average per task):
- Setup & Foundational: ~15 days (1 developer)
- US0 Authentication: ~12 days (1 developer)
- MVP (US0 ‚Üí US4): ~45 days (3 developers in parallel)
- All P1 Stories: ~85 days (4 developers in parallel)
- Complete Platform (P1 + P2 + Polish): ~110 days (4 developers)

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this task breakdown
2. Import tasks into project management tool (GitHub Projects, Jira, Linear)
3. Assign tasks to team members based on expertise
4. Begin with Setup & Foundational (T001-T035)
5. Complete US0 Authentication as top priority
6. Parallelize remaining user stories per dependency order
