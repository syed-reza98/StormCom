# Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Pre-Implementation Gate - Validate requirements quality for CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues before Phase 2 coding begins. This checklist serves as "unit tests" for the specification, ensuring requirements are complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and ready for implementation.

**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Feature**: StormCom Multi-tenant E-commerce Platform  
**Branch**: `001-multi-tenant-ecommerce`  
**Focus**: CRITICAL + HIGH severity gaps from specification analysis  
**Audience**: Development team (blocking gate before Phase 2)

**Phase 2/Constitution/Testing**: 36 items (CHK101-CHK136)

**Traceability**: 95% of items include spec section references or gap markers  
**Focus**: Pre-implementation gate blocking Phase 2 until CRITICAL + HIGH issues resolved  
**Scope Decision**: Included essential edge cases (CHK002, CHK009, CHK054, CHK056, CHK058, CHK060, CHK091), Phase 2 high-priority items only, and constitution enforcement mechanisms

## Usage Instructions

1. **Blocking Gate**: Phase 2 implementation CANNOT begin until all CRITICAL items (CHK001-CHK016) are resolved
2. **High Priority**: Resolve HIGH items (CHK017-CHK044) before US3 checkout and US5 subscription implementation
3. **Medium Priority**: Resolve MEDIUM items (CHK045-CHK071) before Phase 10 security and Phase 18 infrastructure
4. **Progressive Validation**: Use this checklist iteratively - mark items complete as requirements are updated in spec.md
5. **Traceability**: Update spec.md section references when requirements are added/modified
6. **Team Review**: Use this as a requirements review checklist in PR reviews for spec.md changes

**Next Action**: Address CON-001 (MFA backup codes) and GAP-001 (data retention tasks) immediately before any Phase 2 coding begins.
