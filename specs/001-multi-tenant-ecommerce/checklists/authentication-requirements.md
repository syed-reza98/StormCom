## Validation Results

### ✅ All Quality Checks PASSED

- **Content Quality**: Specification is business-focused, technology-agnostic, and written for non-technical stakeholders
- **Requirement Completeness**: All requirements are testable, unambiguous, and fully specified
- **Success Criteria**: All criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation details
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: Comprehensive coverage of all authentication flows and edge cases
- **Edge Cases**: Detailed workflows for error handling, security enforcement, and edge conditions
- **Feature Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command

### Notes

- Authentication is a P0 (blocking priority) feature as it's the entry point for all other functionality
- Specification properly separates concerns: Super Admin, Store Admin/Staff, and Customer authentication flows
- Security requirements are comprehensive: password policies, MFA, session management, account lockout, rate limiting, audit logging
- All edge cases include specific error messages and user guidance
- Success criteria include performance targets aligned with constitution requirements (e.g., <2s login, <60s session invalidation)

## Readiness for Next Phase

✅ **READY FOR `/speckit.plan`**

The authentication specification is complete, validated, and ready for implementation planning. All requirements, edge cases, success criteria, and entities are well-defined with no ambiguities or missing information.
