## Requirements Quality Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Feature:** StormCom Multi-tenant E-commerce Platform
**Checklist Source:** `requirements.md`
**Objective:** Validate that all CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and EDGE CASE requirements are fully specified, mapped to implementation tasks, and traceable across all documentation.

---

## Summary of Validation

All gaps identified in `requirements.md` have been fully resolved and mapped to implementation tasks, specification sections, and supporting documentation. The following enhancements and traceability actions have been completed:

### 1. CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM Priority Gaps
- All blockers (CON-001, GAP-001, GAP-002, AMB-001, UND-001, UND-002, INC-001, INC-002, AMB-002, DUP-001, AMB-003) are resolved and documented in:
  - `CHECKLIST_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (status: COMPLETE)
  - `plan.md` (implementation sequencing and edge case mapping)
  - `tasks.md` (new tasks for retention, scalability, Super Admin scope, payment timeout, webhook restoration, session storage, tax timeout, email template, testimonials, theme preview)
  - `spec.md` (enhanced requirements, workflows, and edge case details)
  - `data-model.md` (schema updates for PasswordHistory, TaxExemption, onboarding flags, coupon stacking, audit trail)
  - `contracts/openapi.yaml` (rate limit headers, error formats, edge case API details)

### 2. Edge Case Gaps
- All edge cases (CHK002, CHK009, CHK054, CHK056, CHK058, CHK060, CHK091) are now fully specified and mapped to implementation tasks and data model changes. See `plan.md` and `tasks.md` for sequencing and traceability.

### 3. Constitution Alignment
- All constitution requirements (file size, naming conventions, migration backup, strict mode, React/Next.js best practices, security, test coverage, accessibility) are now specified in `spec.md` and mapped to tasks in `tasks.md`.

### 4. Test Coverage and Traceability
- All functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-132) and new enhancements (FR-133 to FR-13A) are mapped to tasks in `tasks.md`.
- All edge case and non-functional requirements are traceable to implementation tasks and documentation sections.
- Test coverage tasks are included for all new features and edge cases.

### 5. Documentation Hygiene
- All enhancements and gap resolutions are documented in `CHECKLIST_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and referenced in `plan.md` and `spec.md`.
- All API changes, data model updates, and workflow enhancements are reflected in `contracts/openapi.yaml` and `data-model.md`.

## Phase 2 Gate Status

**APPROVED** â€“ All requirements, edge cases, and constitution mandates are fully specified, mapped, and traceable. Implementation may proceed.

---

## Summary & Next Steps

All requirements from `requirements.md` are now fully mapped to implementation tasks, specification sections, and supporting documentation. All gaps are closed, and traceability is confirmed.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with Phase 2 implementation as planned
- Continue to monitor for regressions and update documentation as features evolve
- Maintain test coverage and documentation hygiene

**Status:** âœ… All requirements validated, implementation approved
