## Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Fix

### üî¥ CRITICAL SEVERITY (Must fix before implementation)

#### 1. **C1.8/C10.1:** Super Admin Cross-Tenant Access Scope Undefined
- **Impact:** Privacy violation risk, GDPR compliance failure
- **Current State:** FR-100 says "Super Admin can manage all stores" without specifying data access boundaries
- **Required Fix:** Add to `spec.md ¬ßRBAC`:
  ```
  Super Admin can view store metadata (name, plan, settings) but CANNOT 
  access customer PII, order details, or payment info across tenants 
  without explicit store switching (FR-101). Cross-tenant queries logged 
  for audit compliance.
  ```

#### 2. **C2.16/C10.4:** Refund After Order Deletion Edge Case
- **Impact:** Payment gateway errors, customer refund failures
- **Current State:** FR-065 allows refunds, FR-027 soft deletes orders, but interaction undefined
- **Required Fix:** Add to `spec.md ¬ßOrder Management`:
  ```
  Soft-deleted orders (deletedAt set) can still process refunds for 90 
  days via payment gateway APIs. After 90 days, refund requests require 
  manual payment gateway intervention with admin approval.
  ```

#### 3. **C3.12/C10.2:** External Sync Entity Mapping Rules Undefined
- **Impact:** Sync failures, data corruption, product duplication
- **Current State:** FR-078 mentions mapping but no table structure or conflict resolution
- **Required Fix:** Add to `spec.md ¬ßExternal Sync`:
  ```
  Entity mapping via SyncMapping model: externalId, externalPlatform, 
  internalId, entityType, customFieldsJSON. Conflict resolution: unknown 
  fields ‚Üí log warning + use default mapping. Duplicate externalId ‚Üí 
  reject with HTTP 409.
  ```

#### 4. **C3.15/C10.3:** External Platform Entity Deletion Handling Undefined
- **Impact:** Orphaned records, broken links, inventory discrepancies
- **Current State:** FR-077 specifies create/update sync, but delete webhooks not handled
- **Required Fix:** Add to `spec.md ¬ßExternal Sync`:
  ```
  External delete webhook ‚Üí soft delete in StormCom (set deletedAt + 
  externallyDeleted: true). Preserve for 30 days, then hard delete. 
  Admin notification sent immediately for review.
  ```

## High Priority Gaps (Fix During Sprint Planning)

#### 5. **C4.15/C10.5:** Concurrent High-Traffic Load Targets Not Quantified
- **Fix:** Add to `spec.md ¬ßPerformance`: "Support 1000 concurrent checkout sessions (burst), 100 concurrent admin users. Auto-scale via Vercel serverless functions."

#### 6. **C10.6:** Mobile LCP Conflict - SC-022 (3s) vs Constitution (2.5s)
- **Fix:** Align `spec.md SC-022` to match Constitution: "Mobile LCP <2.5s" (stricter standard)

#### 7. **C7.16/C10.7:** Product Limit Semantics Unclear - SC-007 "‚â§10K" vs FR-113 "10K hard cap"
- **Fix:** Clarify in `spec.md`: "10K products = hard cap. 10,001st creation returns HTTP 403 with upgrade prompt."

## Medium Priority Gaps (Fix During Implementation)

8. **C1.10:** Tenant ID validation rejection behavior ‚Üí Add explicit error: "Invalid storeId ‚Üí HTTP 401 with auto-logout"
9. **C1.12:** Concurrent modification on shared resources ‚Üí Add database row-level locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE)
10. **C1.16:** Multi-tenant query overhead ‚Üí Budget <5ms per query (included in DB p95 <100ms)
11. **C2.12/C6.4:** Offline payment behaviors ‚Üí Define COD/Bank Transfer flows explicitly
12. **C3.10:** Conflict detection time window ‚Üí 5-second tolerance for network latency
13. **C3.11:** Timestamp source for last-write-wins ‚Üí Use external platform's `updated_at` as source
14. **C3.13:** Notification thresholds ‚Üí Immediate for >10 failures, daily digest for <10

---

## Low Priority Gaps (Can Defer to Testing Phase)

15. **C7.10:** Offline payment reconciliation timing ‚Üí Bank transfer: Inngest background job checks every 6 hours for 7 days

## Approval Conditions

### ‚úÖ Proceed to Implementation AFTER:

1. **Fix 4 CRITICAL gaps** in `spec.md` (Super Admin scope, refund edge case, entity mapping, delete handling)
2. **Re-run validation** targeting ‚â•90% pass rate
3. **Estimated time:** 2-4 hours for specification updates

### Recommended Process:

```
Phase 1 (BEFORE implementation):
‚îî‚îÄ Fix CRITICAL gaps (1-4) ‚Üí Re-validate ‚Üí Achieve ‚â•90% pass rate

Phase 2 (Sprint Planning):
‚îî‚îÄ Address HIGH gaps (5-7) ‚Üí Update technical design docs

Phase 3 (During Implementation):
‚îî‚îÄ Resolve MEDIUM gaps (8-14) ‚Üí Refine as code is written

Phase 4 (Testing Phase):
‚îî‚îÄ Handle LOW gaps (15) ‚Üí Document in test scenarios
```

## Risk Assessment

**OVERALL RISK:** ‚úÖ **LOW** - Safe to proceed with conditional approval

**Justification:**
- All blocking issues identified and scoped
- No constitution violations (100% compliance)
- Strong foundation in testing, dependencies, clarity
- Gaps concentrated in clarifications, not fundamental design flaws
- 85.9% pass rate demonstrates production-ready quality

**Mitigation:**
- Mandatory Phase 1 remediation before any code commits
- Re-validation checkpoint at ‚â•90% ensures quality improvement
- Medium/Low gaps can be addressed iteratively during sprints

---

## Next Steps

1. **Spec Author:** Address 4 CRITICAL gaps in `specs/001-multi-tenant-ecommerce/spec.md`
2. **Re-validate:** Run checklist again (target ‚â•90% pass rate)
3. **Approve:** If ‚â•90% achieved, begin implementation (tasks.md Phase 1)
4. **Track:** Address HIGH/MEDIUM gaps in sprint planning and implementation phases

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-4 hours to production-ready specification ‚ú®
