**Status**: 37 items require attention (35% of 106 total checklist items)

## 🔴 High Priority (Security/Multi-tenancy) - 3 items

### CHK106 - Multi-tenant Isolation Test Scenarios
**Category**: Multi-Tenant Isolation (Critical)  
**Issue**: No explicit test scenarios for cross-tenant attack vectors (e.g., ID manipulation, SQL injection attempts)  
**Current State**: US1 Scenario 3 covers store switching but lacks security testing  
**Recommendation**: Add acceptance scenarios testing:
- Direct ID manipulation attempts across tenants
- SQL injection attempts bypassing Prisma middleware
- JWT token tampering to access other stores
- API endpoint authorization bypass attempts

**References**: US1 Scenario 3, FR-095

---

### CHK059 - Store Deletion with Active Orders/Subscriptions
**Category**: Edge Case Coverage  
**Issue**: FR-080 covers account deletion but not store deletion when active subscriptions or orders exist  
**Current State**: Gap in requirements  
**Recommendation**: Define requirements for:
- Blocking store deletion when active subscription exists
- Allowing store deletion but archiving orders for retention period
- Admin override capabilities with warning prompts
- Customer notification requirements

**References**: FR-080 (account deletion)

---

### CHK093 - Soft-Deleted Resources and Plan Limits
**Category**: Ambiguities & Conflicts  
**Issue**: FR-047 defines plan limits but doesn't specify if soft-deleted resources count toward limits  
**Current State**: Ambiguous  
**Recommendation**: Clarify that soft-deleted resources (deletedAt IS NOT NULL):
- DO count toward plan limits during 90-day grace period
- DO NOT count after hard deletion
- Provide "Reclaim Space" admin action to force hard delete

**References**: FR-047 (plan limits), data-model.md (soft deletes)

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority (Edge Cases & UX) - 13 items

### CHK002 - Duplicate SKU Handling
**Category**: Requirement Completeness  
**Issue**: FR-007 enforces unique SKUs per store but no requirements for duplicate detection UX  
**Recommendation**: Add requirements for inline validation with suggested alternatives

**References**: FR-007

---

### CHK004 - Concurrent Plan Limit Checks
**Category**: Requirement Completeness  
**Issue**: FR-047 checks limits but no handling for concurrent operations exceeding limits simultaneously  
**Recommendation**: Add database-level constraint enforcement requirements

**References**: FR-07N

---

### CHK009 - Email Variable Fallbacks
**Category**: Requirement Completeness  
**Issue**: FR-078 lists email types but no fallback behavior for missing template variables  
**Recommendation**: Define fallback behavior (e.g., "Dear Customer" if {firstName} missing)

**References**: FR-078

---

### CHK012 - Advanced Reports Scope
**Category**: Requirement Completeness  
**Issue**: FR-064 mentions "advanced reports" without defining scope  
**Recommendation**: Specify available report types (custom vs predefined)

**References**: FR-064

---

### CHK017 - Prominent Display Measurability
**Category**: Requirement Clarity  
**Issue**: "Prominent display" for featured products lacks measurable criteria

**References**: FR-008 (featured products)

---

### CHK024 - Advanced Reports Scope (Duplicate)
**Category**: Requirement Clarity  
**Issue**: Same as CHK012  
**Recommendation**: Same as CHK012

---

### CHK039 - Visual Hierarchy Measurability

**References**: US13

---

## 🟢 Low Priority (Documentation & Assumptions) - 21 items

### CHK021 - External Sync Latency

**References**: Gap

---

### CHK077 - Browser Support Requirements
**Category**: Dependencies & Assumptions  
**Issue**: No browser support requirements found
