✅ Phase 1 Setup - Initial Files Created
Files Created (8/25 tasks):
✅ .env.example (T001) - Environment variables template with all required services
✅ seed.ts (T002) - Database seed harness with roles, plans, and super admin
✅ prisma.ts (T003) - Prisma client singleton with connection pooling
✅ auth.ts (T004) - NextAuth.js configuration with JWT, MFA, OAuth providers
✅ errors.ts (T005) - API error handler utility with standardized error classes
✅ response.ts (T006) - Response helper with standard format
✅ .gitignore - Updated with comprehensive Next.js/TypeScript/Prisma patterns
✅ package.json - Project dependencies and scripts
Next Steps Required:
To complete Phase 1 (Tasks T007-T012d), you need to:

Install dependencies: Run npm install or pnpm install

Initialize Prisma: Create prisma/schema.prisma from data-model.md

Create remaining utilities:

T007: Zod validation helpers
T008: Rate limit utility (Upstash)
T009-T009b: Tailwind config + shadcn/ui + dark mode
T010: Shared types
T011: Constants
T012-T012d: Sentry monitoring
Run initial setup:

TypeScript Errors Note:
The TypeScript errors you see are expected because:

node_modules not installed yet
Prisma client not generated yet
@types/node not installed yet
These will be resolved after running npm install.

Would you like me to:

Continue creating the remaining Phase 1 files (T007-T012d)?
Create a setup script to initialize the project automatically?
Move to Phase 2 (Prisma schema implementation)?
