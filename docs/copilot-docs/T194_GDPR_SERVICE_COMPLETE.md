# T194: GDPRService Implementation - Complete

**Task**: Implement GDPR compliance service (Phase 16 - US14)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Test Coverage**: 99.63% (21 passing tests)

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive GDPR compliance service providing data subject rights (export, deletion, consent management) as required by EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Files Created

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- ✅ Added 3 new enums:
  - `GdprRequestType`: EXPORT, DELETE
  - `GdprRequestStatus`: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED
  - `ConsentType`: ESSENTIAL, ANALYTICS, MARKETING, PREFERENCES

- ✅ Added `GdprRequest` model:
  - Tracks data export and deletion requests
  - 7-day expiry for export download links
  - Audit trail with IP address and user agent
  - Relations to User and Store (multi-tenant)
  - Indexed on `[userId, type, status]` and `[status, createdAt]`

- ✅ Added `ConsentRecord` model:
  - Granular consent tracking (analytics, marketing, preferences)
  - Records granted and revoked timestamps
  - Audit trail with IP and user agent
  - Unique constraint on `[userId, consentType]`
  - Relations to User and Store

- ✅ Updated User and Store models with GDPR relations

### 2. Service Layer (`src/services/gdpr-service.ts`)
- ✅ **271 lines** of production code
- ✅ 10 public methods:
  1. `exportUserData()` - Synchronous data export
  2. `createExportRequest()` - Async export request with 7-day expiry
  3. `createDeletionRequest()` - Account deletion request
  4. `deleteUserData()` - Anonymize user data (preserves orders)
  5. `recordConsent()` - Record/update consent preference
  6. `getConsentRecords()` - Retrieve user's consents
  7. `updateConsent()` - Update consent (wrapper)
  8. `getRequest()` - Get GDPR request by ID
  9. `getUserRequests()` - Get all user's GDPR requests
  10. `updateRequestStatus()` - Update request status/URL/error

- ✅ **GDPR Compliance Features**:
  - **Right to Access**: Full data export (JSON) with profile, orders, addresses, reviews, consents
  - **Right to Erasure**: Account deletion with data anonymization
  - **Right to Withdraw Consent**: Granular consent management
  - **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary fields
  - **Audit Trail**: IP address and user agent logged for all requests

### 3. Prisma Client (`src/lib/prisma.ts`)
- ✅ Singleton Prisma Client instance
- ✅ Development logging enabled
- ✅ Prevents multiple instances during hot reload

### 4. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/services/gdpr-service.test.ts`)
- ✅ **21 comprehensive tests** covering all methods
- ✅ **99.63% code coverage** (only 1 unreachable line)
- ✅ Tests include:
  - Export with/without storeId filtering
  - Export request creation with duplicate prevention
  - Deletion request creation with duplicate prevention
  - Data anonymization in transaction (preserves orders)
  - Consent recording with timestamps
  - Consent retrieval with filtering
  - Request status updates with metadata
  - Error handling (user not found, already deleted, pending requests)

## Implementation Details

### Data Export Structure

```typescript
{
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
    phone: string | null;
    role: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    lastLoginAt: Date | null;
  };
  orders: Order[];         // With orderNumber, total, status
  addresses: Address[];    // All shipping/billing addresses
  reviews: Review[];       // Product reviews
  consentRecords: Consent[]; // Tracking preferences
  exportedAt: Date;        // Export timestamp
}
```

### Data Deletion (Anonymization)

**Preserves Orders** (GDPR Article 6.1(c) - Legal obligation for financial records):
- Orders remain in database with anonymized user reference
- Enables compliance with tax/audit requirements

**Deletes/Anonymizes**:
- ✅ User profile: `email` → `deleted_user_<id>@deleted.local`
- ✅ User profile: `name` → `Deleted User`
- ✅ User profile: `phone` → `null`
- ✅ User profile: `password` → random hash
- ✅ User profile: `deletedAt` → current timestamp (soft delete)
- ✅ Addresses: Hard deleted
- ✅ Reviews: Hard deleted
- ✅ Wishlist items: Hard deleted
- ✅ Cart items: Hard deleted
- ✅ Consent records: Hard deleted

### Consent Management

**Consent Types** (GDPR Article 7):
- `ESSENTIAL`: Required for site functionality (cannot be revoked)
- `ANALYTICS`: Usage analytics, site performance tracking
- `MARKETING`: Marketing emails, promotional offers
- `PREFERENCES`: Personalization, recommendations

**Consent Fields**:
- `granted`: Current consent status (boolean)
- `grantedAt`: When consent was granted
- `revokedAt`: When consent was revoked
- `ipAddress`: IP address of requester (audit trail)
- `userAgent`: Browser/client information (audit trail)

- ✅ IP address and user agent logged
- ✅ Duplicate request prevention
- ✅ 7-day expiry on export download links
