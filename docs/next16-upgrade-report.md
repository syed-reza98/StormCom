# Next.js 16 Upgrade Report

Status: Complete
Date: 2025-10-25
Author: GitHub Copilot (automated)

## Summary

The project is confirmed on Next.js 16.0.0 with React 19 and TypeScript 5.9.3. No deprecated/removed APIs or config flags from earlier Next.js versions were found in source. A minor runtime issue (404 for `/favicon.ico`) was resolved by adding a favicon and wiring it through `metadata.icons`. Linting was migrated from the removed `next lint` command to the ESLint CLI.

## Actions taken

- Pre-flight checks
  - Verified versions and tooling: Next.js 16.0.0, React 19, TypeScript 5.9.3, Node >= 18, npm
  - Confirmed App Router usage (no legacy Pages Router)
  - Reviewed `next.config.ts` for unsupported flags (none found)
  - Confirmed ESLint configuration exists and Prettier in place
- Codemod
  - Official codemod not required; project already on Next 16
- Manual review
  - Searched for removed/renamed APIs and flags (e.g., AMP, runtimeConfig, dynamicIO, `unstable_rootParams`, `devIndicators`) — none present in source
  - Validated routing structure and `src/app/layout.tsx` setup
- Fixes
  - Resolved favicon 404: added `public/favicon.svg` and declared in `metadata.icons`
  - Migrated lint scripts from `next lint` to `eslint .`
- Verification
  - Type check: PASS
  - Production build: PASS
  - Real browser (Playwright) verification: PASS (homepage and `/login` load; favicon link exists and resolves)

## Files changed

- `public/favicon.svg` — New SVG favicon to eliminate runtime 404
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Added `metadata.icons` to advertise favicon to browsers
- `package.json` — Scripts: `lint`/`lint:fix` now use `eslint` CLI instead of removed `next lint`
- `tests/e2e/favicon.spec.ts` — New Playwright E2E tests for favicon presence and `/login` availability

## Build and test results

- Type check: PASS
- Build: PASS
- Lint: FAIL (pre-existing rule violations unrelated to this upgrade)
  - Errors (examples): `react/no-unescaped-entities` in auth pages; `@next/next/no-img-element` warning
- Unit tests: none present
- E2E tests (Playwright): PASS
  - Verified homepage includes `<link rel="icon">` and that the icon resolves (HTTP 200)
  - Verified `/login` responds with 200

## Notes and rationale

- The `next lint` command has been removed in newer Next.js versions; migrating to the ESLint CLI is the recommended path forward. Keeping `eslint-config-next` at the existing version avoids a peer dependency conflict with `eslint@8`. A full ESLint 9 upgrade can be completed separately.
- Adding the favicon via `metadata.icons` ensures browsers don’t fall back to requesting `/favicon.ico`, which previously produced a 404.

## Recommended follow-ups

1. ESLint upgrade (optional but recommended)
   - Upgrade to `eslint@^9` and `eslint-config-next@^16` together to align with Next 16 rules
   - Address the reported lint errors (auth pages unescaped entities, no-img rule)
2. Add more route smoke tests
   - Expand Playwright tests for critical routes in `(auth)` and basic storefront/admin pages as they are implemented
3. Verify Next.js MCP integrations
   - Ensure the Next DevTools MCP server is available per `.mcp.json` and use it during local development
4. CI updates
   - Update lint step in CI to `eslint .` and fail PRs on lint errors
