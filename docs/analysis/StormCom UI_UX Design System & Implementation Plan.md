# StormCom UI/UX Design System & Implementation Plan

## Design Principles & UX Guidelines

* **User-Centric & Polished:** We blend aesthetic sensibility with technical rigor to deliver an **exceptional user experience**. This means delightful interactions, reusable components, fast page loads, cross-browser support, inclusive input methods (touch, keyboard, etc.), and full accessibility. Visual appeal is balanced with performance and usability – every design decision considers both form and function.

* **Consistency & Clarity:** A unified design system ensures consistency across the product’s modules (SMB dashboards, B2B admin portals, consumer storefronts). We adopt a **minimalist approach** (inspired by Vercel’s Geist) – clean layouts, ample whitespace, and clear typography – while introducing **expressive UI touches** (as seen in Vercel’s dashboard) to avoid blandness. Interfaces remain uncluttered, with focus on primary actions, but use subtle animations or visual highlights to engage users. All screens are designed with a clear hierarchy so that users immediately understand navigation and next steps.

* **All States & Scenarios Designed:** We proactively design **empty states, error states, loading states, and edge cases**. No view should be a dead end: if a data table is empty, show a friendly message or prompt to take action (e.g. “No products yet – add your first product” with a CTA). Error states provide recovery actions (e.g. “Failed to load data. Retry.”). This ensures every screen offers a next step or guidance[\[1\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,may%20omit%20visible%20labels%2C%20but), aligning with a forgiving, user-friendly experience.

* **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Accessibility is a first-class principle. We adhere to WCAG guidelines and **prefer native semantic HTML elements** for UI (e.g. real \<button\> for actions, \<a\> for links) to leverage built-in accessibility, only adding ARIA attributes where necessary. Color is never the sole means of conveying information – we use text labels or icons in addition to color cues. We ensure **screen reader support** for all content (meaningful alt text for images, aria-label for icon-only buttons, etc.), **keyboard navigation** for all interactive components, and focus indicators for actionable elements. Our design is inclusive of varied abilities and preferences (e.g. respecting prefers-reduced-motion for users who disable animations, providing sufficient color contrast).

* **Performance-Aware UX:** A great UX is also about feeling fast and responsive. We implement best practices like optimizing images, minimizing layout shifts, and preloading critical assets. Designs account for **loading experiences** – using skeleton screens or spinners to indicate progress for data-heavy views – and ensure interactions feel snappy (e.g. form submissions give immediate feedback). We set reasonable performance budgets (e.g. aim for API calls under 500ms) and test under throttling to guarantee the interface remains responsive. This principle ensures that the polished UI is backed by equally smooth performance.

## Visual Style & Theming

* **Color Palette & Theming:** We use a modern, neutral color palette as a foundation, with the ability to **theme per tenant** for branding. The base theme is light mode (e.g. neutral grays, white backgrounds, black text) with a complementary dark mode. We define design tokens as CSS variables for colors (and other constants) at :root, which makes theming straightforward. For example, \--background, \--foreground, \--primary, etc., are defined globally and can be overridden for each tenant or for dark mode. In dark mode, we simply swap the values (dark theme sets \--background to a dark hue, etc.). This **“design system as code”** approach (using CSS variables and Tailwind classes) gives us explicit control over theming and ensures **minimum contrast** thresholds are met regardless of theme (we use tools like APCA for perceptual contrast). Tenants can thus apply their brand color as the accent (e.g. buttons, highlights) without breaking overall accessibility or design harmony.

* **Typography & Iconography:** We choose a clean, legible sans-serif font for UI (e.g. Inter or similar) to ensure readability at small sizes. Headings use Title Case for consistency (per Vercel’s style) and are sized hierarchically to create clear visual structure. Body text is optimized for readability (e.g. 14-16px base font). We follow typographic best practices: use true quotes and apostrophes (“ ”, ‘ ’) instead of straight quotes[\[2\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,over%20three%20periods), avoid widows/orphans in blocks of text by tweaking content or spacing[\[2\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,over%20three%20periods), and use font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums for numerical data so columns of numbers align neatly[\[2\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,over%20three%20periods). Icons are sourced from a consistent set (Radix Icons or similar) and used sparingly to reinforce text labels (never as the sole indicator). Any icon-only control has an appropriate text label or tooltip for clarity. The aesthetic leans toward **minimal, outlined icons** for a modern look, paired with text when space allows.

* **Layout, Spacing & Grid:** We employ a **responsive 12-column grid** for layouts on desktop, which collapses to fewer columns on tablet and a single column on mobile. Spacing is based on a **4px baseline grid** (Tailwind’s default spacing scale) to maintain visual rhythm and consistency. We ensure every element aligns intentionally – either to the grid or to other elements – with no arbitrary gaps. Key breakpoints (matching Tailwind defaults) are: **sm \= 640px**, **md \= 768px**, **lg \= 1024px**, **xl \= 1280px**, **2xl \= 1536px**, ensuring designs adapt gracefully from small phones up to large monitors. We use **consistent spacing utilities** (e.g. multiples of 4px) for padding/margins, and define standard component sizes (buttons, inputs, etc.) to create a cohesive feel. Visual alignment is not only grid-based but also optical – we adjust for optical centering when needed (e.g. icons and text alignment) so that the UI *looks* balanced even if it’s mathematically centered.

* **Elevation & Depth:** The design is largely clean and minimal (flat UI), but we use **shadows and borders** to indicate layering and interactive depth. **Layered shadows** are used for modals, drop-downs, and tooltips: e.g. an ambient subtle shadow plus a slightly darker, closer shadow to mimic ambient \+ direct lighting. This gives depth without looking too “heavy.” We maintain **crisp borders** on components: a 1px border (using semi-transparent black or white with opacity) combined with shadows helps delineate elements on both light and dark backgrounds. We follow **nested radii** rules – if a card has rounded corners, any element inside (like a button) has equal or smaller corner radius so that corners nest consistently. This attention to detail (an approach Vercel advocates) yields a polished, professional appearance.

* **Visual Feedback & Affordances:** Interactive elements are styled to be obviously clickable/tappable. Buttons use the primary accent color for prominence, with hover/active states that increase contrast or change shade to indicate interactivity. Form controls highlight on focus (e.g. an outline or shadow) to support keyboard users. Links are underlined or use a distinct color, and we avoid “mystery meat” navigation – icons or controls have labels or tooltips. We also implement micro-interactions: e.g. a slight button shadow/lift on hover, or a rotation on a caret icon when an accordion is opened. All animations **respect user preferences** (prefers-reduced-motion) by disabling or simplifying if the user has that setting. Animation is used **sparingly** – only when it adds clarity (e.g. smooth expanding of a collapsed section to draw attention to new content) or delight (subtle card hover effects), and we avoid large, blocking animations that could disrupt the user or cause motion sickness.

## Component Library & Framework

* **Technology Stack Alignment:** Our design system is built to leverage the chosen stack. We use **Next.js App Router** (React 19 with Server Components) which informs how we structure components (favoring server-side rendering for initial UI and using Client Components only for interactive parts). **Tailwind CSS 4** is our core styling framework (utility-first approach), which we supplement with **Radix UI** for unstyled accessible primitives and **shadcn/ui** for pre-built component patterns. Using these ensures we don’t reinvent the wheel for complex components and that we meet a high accessibility bar from the start.

* **Radix UI Primitives:** We utilize Radix UI components (such as Dialog, Menu, Dropdown, Tooltip, etc.) which provide accessible behavior and structure without imposing design. This means things like focus trapping in modals, keyboard navigation in menus, ARIA roles for tabs, and so on are handled. Radix primitives are the foundation for interactive components – for example, our modal component wraps Radix **Dialog** primitives for title, body, overlay, close, etc., ensuring correct semantics. This saves us time and guarantees WCAG-compliant behavior out of the box.

* **shadcn/ui Integration:** We adopt the **shadcn/ui** approach (“copy, don’t install”). Instead of installing a component library, we copy the component code into our project. This gives us **full ownership of the code** and the ability to modify styling or behavior freely. For instance, when we add a \<Button\> component via shadcn, we get a Tailwind-styled button built on Radix’s accessible primitives. We can then adjust its variants (add a new size or color variant) or tweak classes to match StormCom’s branding without being constrained by an external API. This combination (Radix for logic \+ shadcn for style) yields components that are *accessible, themeable, and maintainable*. We also benefit from the community contributions (shadcn’s component recipes and any community registry of components) while not being locked in – every piece is just our code in the repo.

* **Design Tokens & Utilities:** Tailwind’s config is our single source of truth for design tokens (colors, font sizes, spacing, breakpoints). We have extended Tailwind with custom colors (probably mapping to Radix’s color scales or our brand palette) and ensured **dark mode** is supported via the .dark class (or media strategy) using Tailwind’s built-in dark variant. Many shadcn components use CSS variables for colors (e.g. \--background as HSL values) which integrate with Tailwind classes like bg-background that refer to those variables. We maintain these tokens so that changing a color in one place updates it across the UI. Likewise, we use Tailwind utilities for consistent spacing, and we avoid inline styles so that styles remain systematic. If we identify repetitive patterns (like a card style with certain padding, border, shadow), we’ll abstract it either into a Tailwind component class or a small React wrapper so the style stays consistent globally.

* **Key Components and Specs:** All commonly used UI components are specified and documented. This includes:

* **Buttons:** Primary buttons (filled, accent color), secondary (outline or subtle), tertiary (text/link style), and danger variants. Sizes: sm, md, lg – all following a consistent padding and font-size scale. Button states (hover, active, disabled, loading) are clearly defined (e.g., disabled \= lower opacity and no pointer events). We ensure the **“Enter submits on forms”** rule is honored by having a type=submit button in forms.

* **Form Inputs:** Text inputs, textareas, select dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, toggles, date pickers, etc. All use appropriate markup (\<label\> linked via id/for or wrapping the input). We use Radix **Form** primitives where available (or headless ARIA patterns) to ensure things like listbox for select, roving tab index for radio groups, etc., are accessible. We style form controls with Tailwind (e.g., border, focus:ring). Form validation messages are typically shown below the field in a small red italic text, and we might use an icon \+ red outline on error. We ensure error states are **announced** (e.g. using aria-live="polite" on the error message container so screen readers catch validation feedback). For complex inputs (like an auto-complete or combobox), we use a combination of Radix primitives and custom code to maintain accessibility.

* **Layout Components:** Navigation sidebar, topbar, modal dialogs, drawers, tabs, accordions. For example, the **Sidebar** (for admin dashboards) is a collapsible panel with icons+labels for each section. On mobile, it can slide in as a drawer (using Radix **Dialog** or **Popover** with a backdrop). The design uses a slim icon-only nav on very small screens (or a hamburger menu). We ensure the sidebar is navigable via keyboard (arrow key support if we implement accordion menus, etc.) and that a “Skip to content” link is present to jump over the nav.

* **Data Display:** Tables, lists, cards, and charts. **Tables** are styled with minimal borders and row striping for readability. They are made responsive – e.g., collapsing into a stack of key-value pairs on narrow screens if needed. We use the HTML \<table\> for accessibility for tabular data (with proper \<th\> for headers and scope). Large lists (say a list of orders or products) might use virtualization (windowing) to handle performance, ensuring that our implementation (perhaps using a library or our own) doesn’t break accessibility or performance. **Cards** (for storefront product grid or dashboard stats) have a consistent style: rounded corners, shadow, and a defined padding. We follow the **nested radius** principle here as well. **Charts** (sales charts, etc.) use accessible colors (color-blind-friendly palettes) and include labels or patterns so data points aren’t distinguished by color alone.

* **Feedback Components:** Toast notifications (using Radix **Toast**), tooltips (Radix **Tooltip**), loading spinners, progress bars. Each is designed to be non-intrusive but noticeable. For example, **toasts** appear at top-right for admin portal, with a slight slide-in animation, and auto-dismiss after a few seconds. They use polite ARIA live regions so screen readers are notified without disruption. **Loading spinners** are used inside buttons (when an action is processing) or page overlays for heavy loads – but we aim for skeletons instead of long full-page spinners to keep the illusion of speed[\[3\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,).

* **Third-Party Integration:** We also incorporate **NextUI/Radix integration** for certain aspects like accessible headless UI. For icons, if using Radix Icons or similar, we might create a consistent Icon component (that takes a name or component and applies className for size/color). We ensure all icons used for decoration have aria-hidden="true" and are either accompanied by text or labeled appropriately.

* **Utilities & Helpers:** We maintain utility components like \<ClientOnly\> (to handle hydration for certain client components), \<ErrorBoundary\> for graceful error handling in React (perhaps showing a fallback UI), and use Tailwind’s classes for print styles or screenreader-only text (sr-only) where needed (e.g., a visual chart might have an sr-only description for screen readers). We also consider **RTL (right-to-left)** support if needed in the future (Tailwind has an rtl: variant), though Phase 1 is English only.

By building the component library with Radix \+ shadcn \+ Tailwind, we ensure a **consistent developer experience** and a high-quality user experience. Components are documented and tested in isolation (via Storybook and unit tests), and each aligns with the design principles (e.g., a Button or Modal from our library automatically has the proper focus handling, theming, etc., as defined). This setup also accelerates development – the team can pick from a catalog of ready components rather than writing UI from scratch – and guarantees that as we build out features, the look and feel stays cohesive.

## Layout & Responsiveness

* **Mobile-First, Responsive Design:** We design **mobile-first**, meaning our base styles target small screens, and we progressively enhance for larger breakpoints. The app is fully responsive to cover mobile, tablet, and desktop use cases. We use the breakpoint system mentioned earlier (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) which matches the spec’s recommendation. At a high level:

* **Mobile (≤640px)**: UI is single-column. Navigation collapses into a menu (e.g., hamburger icon opens a full-screen menu or a bottom nav for the storefront). Tables transform into card lists or use horizontal scrolling if necessary. We prioritize essential information at the top of pages and use accordions to hide secondary info.

* **Tablet (≈768px)**: A two-column layout may be introduced (e.g., list and detail side-by-side if space permits). Navigation might be a persistent drawer on tablets if there’s room. We test on popular tablet dimensions to ensure touch targets are generous (at least 44px) and layout isn’t cramped.

* **Desktop (≥1024px)**: Multi-column layouts and sidebars are used. For admin, a left sidebar navigation and a top bar can both be visible. Content uses margins for readability on very wide screens (don’t let text span the full width on ultrawide monitors – max-width constraints are set for content). We also consider **ultrawide** displays: beyond \~1440px, we often center content or display additional columns of data but avoid overly long line lengths for text.

* We ensure **responsive coverage** by testing at common breakpoints and some in-between (like iPhone SE small screen, iPad, etc.). We also use dev tools to simulate **safe areas** (for notched displays) and ensure things like navbars account for notch and home indicator (using CSS env(safe-area-inset\*) variables where appropriate).

* **Adaptive Components:** Many components adjust their style/behavior based on viewport:

* The **sidebar navigation** might show icons \+ text on desktop, but icons-only (with tooltips) on a narrow sidebar, and fully hide on mobile (accessible via a menu button).

* **Data tables** might collapse columns on smaller screens. We could implement a pattern where on mobile, each row becomes a block with key-value pairs stacked. For example, an order row with columns (Order \#, Date, Total, Status) on desktop might on mobile turn into a card listing those labels and values vertically.

* **Menus and dropdowns** become full-screen dialogs on mobile for better usability. E.g., a sort filter dropdown could expand to a bottom sheet on mobile with larger tap targets.

* **Charts and graphs** are made responsive by using percentages or dynamic sizing (and we ensure they have accessible fallback text). On small screens, we might hide non-critical charts or provide a summary, because detailed charts can be hard to read on mobile.

* We also utilize Tailwind’s utility classes (like hidden sm:block to show something only on desktop, or flex-col md:flex-row to switch layouts) extensively for clean responsive styling in JSX.

* **Grid System & Spacing:** We apply a **12-column grid** for page layouts at desktop size. Gutters are typically 1rem (16px) on mobile, increasing to 2rem on desktop. Components inside often use a **4 or 8-point spacing** for padding/margins (since our base unit is 4px). We define container max-widths for content so it doesn’t stretch too wide (e.g., a content area might max at \~1200px width centered). **Deliberate alignment** is enforced – we frequently use flexbox and grid rather than absolute positioning, letting the browser manage resizing. For example, in a dashboard card layout, we might use grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 to have a varying number of cards per row depending on width. This fluid approach ensures **no awkward gaps or cut-offs** on different screens.

* **Multi-Tenant UI Considerations:** Since StormCom is multi-tenant, we also consider responsiveness in the context of **white-label storefronts**. Each store’s customer-facing site might have a custom domain and theme, but the underlying responsive behavior and grid system remain consistent. The design system allows customizing colors, logo, maybe typography per tenant, but layout breakpoints and component behavior remain uniform (which makes it easier to maintain quality on all viewports). We ensure that any tenant-specific customizations (like a different logo or a custom CSS snippet) do not break the responsive layout – e.g., logos can scale or wrap on small screens.

* **Cross-Browser Testing:** We support modern browsers per spec (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and mobile browsers). We test responsive design on all (including Safari iOS, which often has quirks). We also disable any default zoom on inputs for iOS (e.g., using correct meta viewport and not using font sizes below 16px for inputs to avoid auto-zoom). We apply touch-action: manipulation on interactive elements to prevent iOS Safari’s double-tap zoom on buttons. All these help ensure the responsive experience is smooth and consistent across devices.

* **No Fixed Dimensions:** We avoid using fixed pixel dimensions in layouts; instead use flex, grid fractions, or percentages so things adapt naturally. Media (images/videos) are made fluid (max-width: 100%) so they shrink on smaller screens. If we have complex overflow scenarios (like a code block or table that is wider than the screen), we implement **responsive overflow handling** (e.g., horizontal scroll containers with a subtle shadow to indicate scrollability, and ensuring overscroll-behavior is properly controlled so scrolling that element doesn’t rubber-band the whole page).

In summary, the responsive design approach ensures the platform is **mobile-friendly out of the box**, and scales up to provide a richer UI on larger screens. The goal is a seamless experience – users can accomplish any task on any device, with the UI adjusting to give them an optimal view. This covers not just layout, but also considerations like larger touch targets on mobile, using device-appropriate UI elements (date pickers, keyboards via inputmode/type attributes, etc.), and maintaining performance on mobile devices (testing on throttled networks and low-end phones as needed).

## Accessibility & UX Best Practices

* **Semantic HTML & ARIA:** We heavily favor semantic HTML to build the interface. This means using the correct elements for the correct purpose: headings (\<h1\>...\<h6\>) in logical order for page structure, \<nav\> for navigation regions, \<main\> for main content, \<form\> for form regions, and so on. Using these gives assistive technologies meaningful information automatically (and helps SEO). Only when a native element can’t achieve what we need do we resort to ARIA roles. Our rule: **Semantics before ARIA** – e.g., use a \<button\> instead of a clickable \<div\> with role button. This reduces the amount of ARIA we have to manually manage. Where we do use ARIA, we follow the ARIA authoring practices (ARIA APG) for patterns. For instance, our custom components (like a combobox or sortable table) will implement specified ARIA roles, properties, and keyboard controls as per WAI-ARIA guidelines (using Radix primitives or downscoping from their examples).

* **Keyboard Navigation:** Every interactive component is reachable and operable via keyboard alone. We ensure a **visible focus indicator** on focusable elements (usually a Tailwind ring or outline that meets contrast requirements). We maintain a logical tab order in the DOM – no unpredictable focus jumps. Complex widgets support arrow key and other expected controls: e.g., menu items are navigable with Up/Down arrow and Enter/Escape, modals trap focus and close with Escape, carousel-like elements use arrow keys, etc. We test by unplugging the mouse and using Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow keys to navigate the app. We include a “Skip to Content” link as the first focusable element on each page that lets keyboard users bypass navigation and we ensure our layouts don’t interfere with this (for example, on focus it becomes visible).

* **Forms & Inputs:** Forms are designed for usability and accessibility:

* Each form field has a corresponding \<label\> (or aria-label if a visual label can’t be shown, but we prefer actual labels). We make the labels clickable (either by using the for attribute or wrapping the input) so the user can focus the field by clicking the text.

* We use proper input types (email, tel, url etc.) and autocomplete attributes to support autofill and mobile keyboards (e.g., numeric keypad for numeric fields). We avoid turning off autocomplete globally; instead we only disable it where it might invoke password managers incorrectly (like a one-time code field).

* Validation is handled by giving feedback **after submission or on blur** (no disabling of the submit button pre-emptively). This way, the user can attempt to submit and then see which fields are in error (and we auto-focus the first invalid field on submit). Inline validation messages are placed right next to the field (below or to the right) so the association is clear. For screen readers, we may use aria-describedby to link the input to its error message.

* We ensure **generous hit targets** for checkboxes and radio buttons – by making the label clickable and adding padding, the effective hit area is larger. No form control has a tiny clickable area.

* Placeholder text, if used, is subtle and only as a hint (never in place of a label). We often instead use placeholders to show example formatting (e.g., “DD/MM/YYYY” or “Search…”)[\[4\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,for%20headers%20when%20linking%20to). We keep placeholders short and end them with ellipsis if they represent an action (“Search…” in an input)[\[4\]](https://vercel.com/design/guidelines#:~:text=,for%20headers%20when%20linking%20to).

* For multi-step forms or wizards, we clearly indicate steps and allow reviewing before final submission. If the form is long, we chunk it into logical sections with headings (which helps screen reader navigation too).

* We accommodate **password managers and 2FA apps** – for instance, ensure OTP inputs (autocomplete="one-time-code") are easily paste-able and not one-field-per-digit (which makes paste hard, unless we handle that via script while still being accessible).

* When an input has a specific format (say credit card), we don’t hard-block user typing by jamming the field; instead, we let them type freely and then show a validation error if it’s wrong (blocking keystrokes can confuse users, as noted in guidelines).

* **Feedback & Error Messages:** We craft microcopy for errors and system messages that is **clear and actionable**. As Vercel’s guidelines say, error messages shouldn’t just state the problem but guide the user on how to fix it. For example, instead of “Invalid email”, we’d say “Please enter a valid email address.” or if more helpful, “Email must include an ‘@’.”. If an action fails, we might say “Something went wrong — please try again or contact support.” rather than a vague “Operation failed.”. We maintain a **positive tone** even in errors (encouraging, not blaming).

* We use consistent styling for errors: typically red text for error messages, and perhaps a red outline for error fields. For success messages (like “Profile saved”), we might use green or the accent color, and for info or warnings, appropriate colors with icons.

* We also give **confirmation for destructive actions**. If a user performs a major action (delete a product, remove an account), we either ask for a confirm step (modal “Are you sure?”) or provide an undo snackbar after the fact. This aligns with the principle of **forgiving UIs** – users should be able to recover from mistakes.

* **Announcements & Live Regions:** Dynamic changes in content are announced to assistive tech when appropriate. E.g., when a form error appears, a screen reader user should be alerted – we implement this with ARIA live regions (role="alert" on error containers). Similarly, when content loads asynchronously (say, results of a search), we may announce “X results loaded” via a live region. Toast notifications are marked aria-live="polite" so they announce without stealing focus. We avoid too many intrusive announcements; we use “polite” for most, and “assertive” only if it’s critical.

* **Preventing Common Pitfalls:** We address common accessibility pitfalls:

* No **keyboard traps** (except intentional focus trap in modals). If using any custom component that could trap focus (like a third-party map or code editor), we ensure an escape mechanism.

* Sufficient **color contrast** for all text and UI elements. We test with tools and ensure contrast ratios meet at least WCAG AA. We also test various color-blindness simulations to ensure information is still distinguishable (especially in charts or status indicators).

* **No flashing content** that could induce seizures, and careful use of motion: we avoid significant parallax or autoplay animations especially if they can be distracting. All motion is subtle and purposeful.

* **Content Resizing:** We check that zooming the text (200% zoom) or using browser zoom does not break layouts – thanks to our responsive design and flexible units, the interface should adapt. We avoid pixel-perfect layouts that could overflow when text is scaled.

* **Localization readiness:** While Phase 1 is English only, we design with future i18n in mind: UI has space for longer translations (German text tends to be longer, for example), and we avoid putting UI text in images. We also format dates, numbers in a locale-aware way (with libraries) and not assume one format – these hooks are ready when localization happens. This is part of accessibility too (making sure everyone, in any language, can use the app).

* **Screen Reader Testing:** We include actual screen reader testing (using NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver) in our QA process. This helps catch issues like missing labels or reading order problems that automated checkers might miss. For instance, ensuring that when a modal opens, screen reader focus moves into it and background is hidden (we rely on Radix Dialog which handles aria-hidden on background).

* For **complex UI controls** (like a rich text editor for the CMS or a Kanban board for orders), we either use well-established accessible libraries or provide alternative simple views. We keep an eye on ARIA patterns (like ARIA grids or listbox patterns) to implement these in a compliant way if needed.

In sum, our approach treats accessibility as a fundamental part of the design and development process, not an afterthought. By using Radix UI primitives and following Vercel’s and industry best practices, we bake in accessibility from the start. This not only widens our user base (including users with disabilities) but also often improves the UX for everyone (many accessibility improvements like clearer focus or better contrast just make the app easier to use).

## Internal Design & Engineering Workflow

* **Design System Documentation:** We maintain a **living documentation site** for the design system, likely using **Storybook**. Storybook allows us to develop and showcase UI components in isolation, complete with documentation and variations. This is set up with the Next.js framework integration, so we can use Next’s Image and Link inside stories easily[\[5\]](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/nextjs#:~:text=Storybook%20for%20Next,It%20includes). All components (buttons, form fields, modals, etc.) have stories demonstrating their states (hover, focus, disabled, etc.) and variants. We also document guidelines (like when to use which variant) alongside. This serves as a single source for both the design team and engineers to reference. Additionally, we might generate a **design system site** (even if internal) that outlines visual style, typography, color palette, and examples of usage – ensuring new team members can quickly get up to speed.

* **Team Collaboration (“Design Engineering”):** We adopt a workflow similar to Vercel’s **Design Engineering** culture. Rather than a strict handoff, our designers and engineers work closely, often iterating in real time. Designers might start a concept in Figma, but engineers help quickly prototype tricky parts (like an animation or interactive state) directly in code. We use Vercel Preview Deployments for rapid feedback: every PR generates a preview URL that designers can click through to verify the implementation matches the intended design. We encourage sharing videos or screenshots of interactions in Slack for quick async feedback. This tight loop ensures high fidelity – the end result matches the design vision and is also feasible to build (because engineers are involved from the start to advise on complexity vs payoff).

* **Principles & Constitution:** We have a project “Constitution” (coding and design conventions)[\[6\]](https://github.com/syed-reza98/StormCom/blob/edffd9f29ec40b36004e508bc0b597867ff84bf8/docs/SPEC_KIT_USAGE.md#L168-L176) that everyone follows. This likely includes rules like “follow the spec first” (so designs should correspond to the written specs/user stories), coding standards (naming, file structure), and design heuristics (like the accessibility and UX best practices above). New team members are onboarded by reviewing this constitution[\[7\]](https://github.com/syed-reza98/StormCom/blob/edffd9f29ec40b36004e508bc0b597867ff84bf8/docs/SPEC_KIT_INSTALLATION_COMPLETE.md#L125-L133). It’s essentially our agreed-upon best practices – for instance, “All new UI components must have Storybook stories and tests”, “All text strings to be internationalization-ready”, or “No inline styles that override design system without discussion”, etc. This maintains consistency even as the team grows.

* **Ticketing & User Stories:** We break down implementation into **tickets aligned with user stories**. Each user story from the spec (Authentication, Product Management, Checkout, etc.) is treated as an epic with sub-tasks:

* Design tasks (high-fidelity mockups if needed for complex views, although often our design system covers smaller decisions).

* Implementation tasks (coding the pages/components).

* Testing tasks (writing unit/E2E tests for that feature).

* Documentation tasks (updating Storybook, or writing usage docs if needed).

For example, *User Story 2: Product catalog management* might be broken into tasks like *“Implement Product List page (UI \+ state)”*, *“Implement Product Create/Edit form modal”*, *“CSV Import modal UI”*, *“Write tests for product form validations”*, etc. We ensure each task references the design guidelines (e.g., a task would note “Follow form design patterns and use FileDrop component from design system for image uploads”). By structuring this way, **each piece of the UI is accounted for and traceable to a requirement**.

* **Issue Tracking & Iteration:** We’ll likely use GitHub Issues or a similar tool to track these tasks. Our process (spec-driven development) implies we might use the Spec Kit CLI to generate tasks[\[8\]](https://github.com/syed-reza98/StormCom/blob/edffd9f29ec40b36004e508bc0b597867ff84bf8/docs/SPEC_KIT_INSTALLATION_COMPLETE.md#L96-L104). We ensure design sign-off on relevant issues. E.g., before closing a feature’s issue, a designer checks the deployed preview to approve the UI. If issues arise (like a design doesn’t quite work once coded), we iterate – possibly adjusting the design or discussing alternatives (this is where design-engineer collaboration shines, as both can suggest solutions).

* **Testing & QA:** We embed testing into the workflow. For UI, we use **Vitest \+ React Testing Library** for unit tests of components (ensuring, for instance, a Modal closes when the overlay is clicked or a required form field shows an error when left blank). We incorporate **Playwright** for end-to-end testing of critical flows (login, add to cart, checkout, etc.). We also test **accessibility**: using tools like Axe-core integration in tests or Storybook’s a11y addon to automatically catch issues like missing labels or low contrast. We treat a11y issues as bugs to fix before launch. Additionally, we’ll do manual UX QA – testing with a keyboard, screen reader, different device sizes, and making sure the app behaves as expected (for example, ensuring that when you navigate via keyboard, you don’t get stuck, or that switching to dark mode updates all components).

* **Continuous Improvement:** Design system work is never “done” – as we build features, we might identify new patterns to add (maybe a **toast undo feature**, or a **wizard component** for multi-step flows). We incorporate these back into the design system for reuse. We also refactor when needed: if two similar components diverged, we reconcile them into one. The use of shadcn means we need to manually update components if the upstream Radix or accessibility patterns improve – we plan periodic reviews of shadcn’s template or Radix release notes to see if we should update our components. Because we own the code, we handle these carefully via PRs (with thorough testing to avoid regressions).

* **Storybook & Design Review Integration:** We leverage **Storybook’s addons** (like the Accessibility addon to check stories, the Viewport addon to preview components at different screen sizes, etc.). We might also use Storybook for **visual regression testing** (with Chromatic or a similar tool) to catch unintended style changes. The design team can review Storybook stories as a form of design sign-off as well. It’s essentially our living style guide.

* **Developer Experience:** For engineers, we enforce code quality via ESLint (including some a11y lint rules) and Prettier for formatting, so code stays clean and consistent. We also use TypeScript everywhere, which, combined with component props, helps catch incorrect uses of components (making the design system more robust). For instance, if a prop is required (like an aria-label for icon-only button), TypeScript can enforce that. We run type-checks in CI to maintain this rigor. We encourage building new UI first in isolation (in Storybook or a dummy page) before integrating, which aligns with the “design system first” approach.

By following this **workflow and collaboration model**, we ensure that the design and development teams are in sync. The output is a cohesive, modern UI that meets user needs and is delivered with high quality. It also means the design system remains healthy and up-to-date, because it’s woven into our everyday process (not a separate silo). The end result for StormCom is a SaaS product that not only meets its functional requirements but provides a **delightful, accessible, and consistent user experience**, achieved through careful planning, the use of proven frameworks (Next.js, Tailwind, Radix), and a strong internal design-engineering culture.

## Implementation Plan by User Story

Finally, we map the design system and features to the specific StormCom **user stories** to ensure each requirement is implemented with the best UI/UX practices:

* **User Story 0 – Authentication & Authorization (P0):** *“As a Super Admin, Store Admin, Staff, or Customer, I need to authenticate securely with my credentials to access appropriate areas.”* For this, we implement intuitive **Login**, **Registration**, and **Password Reset** screens following our design system. The login page uses a centered card UI with the StormCom logo, an email and password field, and a prominent login button. It supports **password visibility toggle** and **“Remember me”** (with properly labeled checkboxes). Error feedback for wrong credentials is clear (“Invalid email or password. Please try again.”). We incorporate **NextAuth.js** for authentication, customizing the default pages with our UI. The registration page includes required fields and maybe an invite code or tenant selection if applicable. We enforce the password policy at sign-up with an indicator (e.g., a checklist of requirements that turns green as the user meets them). MFA: if enabled, after login we prompt for the TOTP code on a separate screen (or modal). That screen’s design emphasizes security (maybe an icon of a key) and has input fields optimized for one-time-code (and allows pasting from authenticator apps). For **SSO logins** (if enterprise SSO is enabled), we present options like “Login with Google” or SAML SSO links – using provider buttons styled consistently (provider logos and accessible labels). All these forms are responsive (on mobile, they occupy full width, on desktop they’re a centered small card). We also implement account lockout messaging (e.g., after 5 failed attempts, show a message: “Too many failed attempts. Your account is locked for 15 minutes.” as per spec) – this message will be prominent and perhaps guide to password reset. The **authorization** aspect (roles) means post-login, users see different UI navigation – we’ll ensure the nav bar only shows sections the user has permission for (e.g., staff might not see certain admin pages). This is handled in design by dynamic menu construction, and we visually differentiate privileged actions (maybe an icon or lock on admin-only actions).

* **User Story 1 – Create and Manage a Store (P1):** *“As a Super Admin, I create a new store (tenant), assign a Store Admin, and set basic settings so the team can start managing products and sales.”* For onboarding new tenants, we design a **“Create Store” wizard** accessible in the Super Admin dashboard. It might be a modal with steps or a dedicated page. Step 1: enter store details (name, subdomain, etc.), Step 2: assign a Store Admin (maybe pick from existing users or invite via email), Step 3: choose initial plan/tier. We use a **stepper component** to show progress (e.g., “Step 1 of 3”). Each step’s form uses our standard inputs and provides validation (e.g., store subdomain availability check with immediate feedback). After creation, the UI shows a success message (“Store created successfully\!”) and possibly a shortcut to “Go to Store Dashboard”. We also implement a **Tenant Switcher** UI for Super Admins who manage multiple stores: likely a dropdown in the top bar that lists all stores, with search for quick filtering (if there are many). This component must be very clear to avoid confusion – showing the current active store prominently (possibly in the header breadcrumb or as part of the app’s title bar). When the store context switches, we visually confirm it (maybe a brief highlight or a toast “Switched to Store: ABC Fashion”). Additionally, the Super Admin has a **Stores Management** page: a table of all stores with columns (Store Name, Plan, Status, Actions). They can see which stores are active, and click to manage (edit settings or deactivate). The design here uses our table component with action buttons (edit, suspend). For editing store settings, use a form similar to the create wizard, pre-filled. Confirm dangerous actions like deleting a store (perhaps require typing the store name to confirm deletion). Throughout this, we maintain **tenant isolation** cues: e.g., the URL or header changes to indicate which tenant’s data you’re viewing to prevent any ambiguity (as per security requirement, ensure there’s no cross-tenant data visible). The UI reinforces that by not showing multi-tenant data mixed together, only through deliberate Super Admin views.

* **User Story 2 – Product Catalog Management with Variants (P1):** *“As a Store Admin, I create products with variants, categories, etc., supporting bulk operations.”* This is a core piece of the UI – the **Products section** of the admin dashboard. We design a **Product List page**: likely a data table view with columns like Product Name, SKU, Price, Stock, Status. At top, there’s a toolbar with actions: **Add Product**, **Import CSV**, maybe **Bulk Edit** or filter by category. The table supports sorting and searching (search input with placeholder “Search products…”). We use sticky headers for the table so the column labels remain visible on scroll. If the product list is empty (new store), we show an onboarding illustration or message (“No products yet. Get started by adding your first product.”) with an **Add Product** primary button. The **Add Product workflow** could be a multi-tab form (to avoid one giant page). We might use tabs or an accordion: *General Info*, *Pricing*, *Inventory*, *Variants*, *Images*, *SEO*. In each section, we use appropriate inputs (text fields for names, number inputs for price/stock with proper stepper controls, file uploader for images). For variants, the UI might allow adding option names (e.g., Size, Color) and then generating a matrix of variants. We’ll leverage a combination of dynamic form lists and maybe a table for variant entries (each variant with its own SKU, price difference, etc.). This can get complex, so we ensure it’s intuitive: e.g., a button “Add Option” to add a variant dimension, then “Add Variant” to create combination entries. We enforce **SKU uniqueness** per store – if a duplicate SKU is entered, an inline error on that field says it already exists. We also reflect slug uniqueness similarly. The **Images uploader** may use a drag-and-drop area or just a file input styled nicely; after upload (to Vercel Blob or Cloud storage) we show thumbnails. Users can reorder images (maybe drag-and-drop ordering, which we implement with accessible drag handles, and ensure aria-live announcements like “Moved image 2 to position 1”). Bulk operations: **CSV Import** – clicking Import opens a modal with instructions (perhaps referencing required CSV columns). The design will include a file picker area and possibly a link to download a sample CSV. Once a file is chosen, we show a progress indicator (uploading, then processing). If any rows fail validation (like duplicate SKUs), we present a report: maybe the modal turns into a results screen listing errors by row. We allow the user to download an error CSV as per spec (with problematic rows and reasons). This UI needs to clearly separate **successful imports vs errors**, and reassure that successful ones are in while errors were skipped (maybe “150 products imported successfully. 5 rows failed to import.” and then details). We also ensure this modal is large enough (for desktop) or full-screen on mobile for readability. Category management might be via a **Categories page** or inline in the product form (like a multi-select). Possibly we provide a simple CRUD UI for categories and brands (list with add/edit/delete), likely in Settings. We must ensure all these forms and lists are consistent with our design system components. On small screens, product management still works: the product list table might become a list of cards (each card showing key info and a “Edit” button). The product form can scroll or be broken into accordion sections.

* **User Story 3 – Checkout with Shipping and Tax (P1):** *“As a Customer, I complete checkout by providing shipping address, selecting shipping method, and seeing accurate tax and shipping charges.”* This is on the **consumer storefront**, which has a different context than the admin – it’s the public e-commerce site for each store. The design here focuses on conversion and ease of use. **Checkout flow**: We likely use a single-page or multi-step checkout. A common approach is multi-step on one page (accordion or tabs: *Cart review*, *Shipping Info*, *Payment*). In the shipping step, customer enters their address (we use proper autocomplete attributes to help autofill). We might integrate an address suggestion API for convenience (but with the ability to type manually). After address is entered, we display available **shipping methods** (radio buttons with name and cost). The UI calculates tax based on address (we integrate a tax API or use built-in rules per region). We display a summary of **order totals** updating in real time: items subtotal, shipping, tax, and grand total. The user can review this before payment. For **payment**, we integrate with Stripe or SSLCommerz – either redirect to their hosted checkout or embed a payment form. If embedding (e.g., card inputs), we ensure it’s secure (probably using Stripe Elements in an \<iframe\> which comes styled by Stripe – but we can tweak to match our theme). We provide options if available, like saved cards or alternative methods (PayPal, etc., possibly in later phases). Throughout, we provide clear error handling – e.g., if the **shipping calculation fails** (timeout), we show a notice and allow retry, per spec we retry 3 times silently and then maybe show a message like “Shipping rates could not be loaded, please try again or choose a default option”. Similarly, if tax calc fails, we don’t block checkout – we warn taxes will be applied as 0 and the order flagged for review (this info can be shown as a non-blocking alert on the summary). We also handle edge cases like no shipping available to the address (show a clear error at the shipping step). The **UI design** for checkout uses a clean, single-column form for address/payment on mobile, and a two-column layout on desktop (form on left, order summary on right). The summary on right shows item thumbnails and names (so user remembers what they’re buying), and totals. There’s also a **Cart page** before this where users can adjust quantities or remove items. Cart page shows items in a table or list form, with an “Update” button (or auto-update on quantity change). If cart is empty, show an informative page (“Your cart is empty, continue shopping”). We also incorporate **coupon code** entry UI either in cart or at checkout. If a coupon is applied, show the discount line in summary. Visual cues like a lock icon on the payment section can reassure security. After successful checkout, a **Confirmation page** thanks the customer, shows an order number, and summary, with a prompt to check email for receipt. Possibly offer account creation if they were guest (like “Create an account to track your order” CTA). All these UI pieces follow our style: use the store’s branding (logo, colors), responsive design, and accessible forms. We also optimize for **speed** – e.g., use Next.js dynamic rendering or edge functions to keep the checkout snappy, and make sure the main thread isn’t blocked (especially important on mobile devices). The goal is to minimize friction so the customer can complete the purchase confidently.

* **User Story 3a – Customer Storefront Browsing & Shopping (P1):** *“As a Customer, I browse products, search, add to cart, and manage my wish list.”* This covers the **storefront experience** prior to checkout. Key components:

* **Homepage & Product Listing:** The homepage might feature hero banners, featured products, categories, etc., depending on the store. We ensure this is customizable per tenant (maybe a simple CMS controls what is featured). The design uses our components like card grids for product displays. The product listing (category or search results page) uses a responsive grid of product cards. Each **product card** shows image, name, price, maybe rating, and an “Add to Cart” button or at least a quick-buy icon. On hover (desktop), the card might show additional actions (quick add, wish list button). On mobile, a simple tap navigates to product page.

* **Product Details Page:** This page is critical for conversion. We present a image gallery (the main image with thumbnails for additional images, possibly a modal or zoom feature). The product title, price, description, and options (variants selection) are clearly laid out. If there are reviews, show rating stars and a link to reviews section. The **Add to Cart** button is prominent and sticks on screen if needed (on mobile, perhaps a sticky footer bar with the price & add-to-cart). We also have a **quantity selector** and show stock status (e.g., “In Stock” or “Only 2 left” urgency messages). If a variant is out of stock, we disable that option and note it. We handle edge cases like if an option combination isn’t available, the UI might grey out the Add button and show a message. We allow **wishlist** action: a heart icon that users can toggle to save the item. If clicked, and the user is not logged in, we prompt login (or could allow a temporary local wishlist).

* **Search & Navigation:** A search bar at top (with placeholder “Search products…”) allows customers to find items. We implement it to show suggestions or at least perform a full-text search. The nav menu lists product categories; on mobile this is a hamburger menu with an overlay listing categories and possibly account links. On desktop, maybe a top nav or sidebar if the design calls for it. We ensure navigation is easy and fast – using Next.js prefetching for quick page transitions. For filtering products, a sidebar or dropdown with filters (price sliders, category checkboxes, etc.) is provided on listing pages. These controls use our form components and update the product list (either via navigate with query or using client-side filtering).

* **Cart & Mini-Cart:** We may implement a mini-cart dropdown accessible via a header icon (cart icon with item count). On click, it shows the current cart items and a checkout button. This uses our drawer/modal component. It’s scrollable and accessible (focus trap inside, close on Escape). This allows a quick view/edit of cart from any page. The full Cart page we described in story 3\.

* **Wish List:** Logged-in customers can have a Wishlist page listing their saved items. We reuse the product card design here, possibly with an “Add to Cart” button on each. If the wishlist is empty, show a message and maybe recommend popular products. Wish list actions (remove or move to cart) are provided. We ensure that the heart icon state is synced – if an item is in wishlist, the icon on product cards is filled. All of this requires the front-end to communicate with the backend appropriately (likely via Next.js API routes or a client component calling our API).

* **Performance & SEO:** The storefront is optimized for Core Web Vitals. We use Next.js Image for images (with responsive srcset so we serve smaller images on mobile). We statically generate as much as possible (e.g., product pages can be pre-rendered and revalidated). SEO-wise, each page has proper meta tags, titles, and uses clean URLs (structured as /products/\[slug\], etc.). We ensure the design doesn’t hinder SEO (e.g., avoid lazy-loading above-the-fold content in a way that search engines can’t see).

* **Accessibility on Storefront:** We treat the storefront like a public website – it should be exemplary in accessibility. All interactive pieces (the image carousel, etc.) have fallbacks or controls (e.g., carousel can be paused, operated by keyboard). We provide text alternatives for product images (perhaps the product title as alt, or a more descriptive alt if available). We consider accessibility in dynamic updates like when an item is added to cart, we could announce “Added \[Product\] to cart, $X total” in a live region for screen readers. We also ensure that if JavaScript is off, the core flow (browsing, adding to cart, checkout) still works via normal form posts and page loads – this is part of progressive enhancement and also helps SEO (since content is not exclusively client-rendered).

* **User Story 4 – Order Lifecycle & Documents (P1):** *“As Staff, I process orders from pending to delivered, generate invoices/packing slips, send notifications, and handle cancellations/refunds.”* This is the **Orders section** of the admin dashboard. We design an **Order List view** for staff: a table of orders with key info (Order \#, Date, Customer, Total, Status). Status might be color-coded badges (Pending, Shipped, Completed, Cancelled, etc.). Staff can filter by status or search by customer name or order number. Clicking an order opens the **Order Details page**. On that page, we show all details of the order:

* Customer info (name, email, address), possibly as a card.

* Payment info (payment method, status, transaction ID).

* Items list (product names, quantities, prices, subtotal per item).

* Totals (subtotal, tax, shipping, total paid).

* Status timeline: a visual list or timeline component showing each stage (Ordered, Paid, Shipped, Delivered, etc. with timestamps). We highlight the current status.

* Actions for staff: Depending on current status, actions like **“Mark as Shipped”**, **“Record Payment”** (if awaiting payment), **“Cancel Order”**, **“Issue Refund”** (if eligible). These might be buttons at the top or bottom of the page. We use modal confirmations for potentially destructive actions like cancel or refund (“Are you sure you want to cancel this order? This will notify the customer and restock items.”).

* Generating documents: Provide buttons or links to **“Download Invoice PDF”** and **“Print Packing Slip”**. These could open a new window with a printer-friendly format (we might leverage a special route or component for rendering the invoice in HTML, or generate a PDF server-side). The UI for these is straightforward – a button with an icon (e.g., printer icon) and text. We ensure the target documents have proper formatting (using print CSS or PDF).

* If partial actions are allowed (partial shipments or refunds), the UI needs to accommodate selecting which items or quantity to refund/ship. For example, an **“Issue Refund”** action might open a modal listing items with checkboxes or quantity inputs to refund certain items, or a field to input a custom refund amount (with validation not to exceed paid total). We implement safeguards as per spec: e.g., cannot refund more than paid (the UI should calculate and prevent it), and if an item was already refunded or not yet paid, we adjust options.

* We also consider **notifications**: staff might trigger resending of an email (like “Resend Order Confirmation”). If so, a simple button triggers that, and we show a toast “Confirmation email sent.”.

* **Concurrency & Edge Cases:** If multiple staff are viewing or editing orders, our design can’t fully handle backend concurrency, but we ensure the frontend reacts gracefully. For instance, if the order status changes (by webhook or another user) while a staff has it open, we might show an info alert on update (“This order has been updated by another user.”) after a refresh or via WebSocket events. For now, perhaps we assume low concurrency but we design modals to fetch latest data on open.

* **Order Locking:** Spec mentions not canceling orders that received late payments – this is more backend logic, but we can reflect it by disabling cancel button if payment is confirmed, etc. We just ensure the UI allows idempotent actions (e.g., clicking “Mark as Shipped” twice won’t double-ship because second time button might be disabled or status updated).

* **UI Navigation:** The order detail page should have a way to go back to list (a back link or breadcrumb “Orders”). After certain actions, perhaps auto-navigate or at least update status on the page.

* We make sure this page is printable (for internal records or for printing packing slip directly from it, though we also have a dedicated slip).

* Responsive: On mobile, the order detail might be a long scrolling page. We could use accordions for sections like customer info, items, etc., to make it navigable.

* **User Story 5 – Subscription Plan Selection & Limits (P1):** *“As a Store Owner, I select a subscription plan and the system enforces plan limits.”* This involves both a **billing UI** for the store owner and indicators in the app where limits apply.

* **Plans & Billing Page:** In the Store’s settings or a dedicated Billing section, we present available plans (Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise, for example) with a comparison of features/limits. We might use pricing cards or a table. The current plan is highlighted. The owner can click **“Upgrade”** or **“Downgrade”** on a plan. Upgrading might integrate with a payment flow (e.g., going to a Stripe checkout or updating credit card on file). For MVP, maybe it just records choice and an admin follows up, but given NextAuth and Stripe, we likely integrate Stripe for self-service. The UI should clearly show the cost, billing cycle, and what’s included. We also show usage vs limits for the current plan: e.g., **API calls used this month: 300/1000** with a progress bar, **Products: 120/500**, etc. If the store is nearing a limit (say \>80% usage), we might show a warning color on that metric.

* **Enforcing Limits in UI:** When a user tries to exceed a limit, the UI should stop them with a friendly message. For example, if their plan limit is 100 products and they already have 100, the **“Add Product”** button could be disabled or upon click, show a modal: “You have reached your product limit for the Free plan. Please upgrade to add more products.” This ties into spec FRs about plan limits. We implement similar checks for other resources: if they try to add a staff user beyond the limit, or an API call heavy action beyond rate limits. Rate limits (60/min etc.) are mostly backend, but if we get a 429 response, we display the error in-app (“You have exceeded the API rate limit, try again later”) possibly as a toast or inline message.

* We also have to handle **plan changes**: If a user downgrades and their data is above the new plan’s limits (e.g., they have 120 products but new plan allows 100), we follow spec by marking the extras as over-limit but not deleting. In UI, we could highlight over-limit items (maybe an alert at top: “You have 20 products over your plan limit. Upgrade to Pro or remove some products.”). We may provide a filtered view of “over limit” items or just rely on messaging.

* **Grace Periods:** If plan expired, some actions become read-only. The UI might show banners (“Your subscription expired, your store is in read-only mode. Renew within 7 days to avoid interruption.”). We ensure in UI to disable or hide actions that aren’t allowed in read-only mode, and explain why.

* **Multi-Tenancy for Plans:** Super Admin might have a global view of all stores and their plans (maybe not in MVP, but likely). That could be an admin-only page with a table of stores and plan, where they can manually override or assign plans. The UI would be simple (select new plan from dropdown, etc.).

* Design-wise, the **plan cards** should use our card component, with perhaps a highlighted border or badge on the current plan. They should list key features in bullet points for clarity. We might incorporate logos or icons for plan names (like a crown icon for enterprise, etc., but minimally to keep it aesthetic). The **usage bars** should be clear and possibly color-coded (green ok, yellow nearing, red at limit). Tooltips can clarify any ambiguous metrics.

* **User Story 6 – Inventory Tracking & Alerts (P1):** *“As a Store Admin, I maintain accurate stock per product with audit trails and receive low-stock alerts.”* The **Inventory Management UI** ties into products but might have its own dedicated view focusing on stock:

* Possibly an **Inventory dashboard** that lists products (or variants) with their current stock and a status (in stock, low, out of stock). We can reuse the product table but focused on stock columns, or have a special list of just low-stock items. Perhaps filters like “Show low stock only”.

* Each product’s edit page already has stock fields, but an **Audit Trail** for stock changes could be displayed: e.g., a list under inventory section: “Aug 1: \+50 (restock by Admin A)”, “Aug 5: \-1 (order \#1001)”. This could be a simple table of events. If implementing, we ensure it’s clear and paginated if long.

* **Low-stock alerts:** We integrate with Next.js API or Cron to check stock. For the UI, we provide a way to set alert threshold per product or a global threshold. The product edit page might have a “Low stock threshold” field. Also a global setting “Send me an email when any product stock falls below X”. Within the app, we can have a **bell icon (notifications)** in the header. When stock is low, a notification appears there (e.g., “5 products are low in stock”). Clicking it could navigate to the inventory page filtered to low stock items.

* We also highlight low stock visually in the UI: e.g., on the product list or inventory list, items below threshold have an orange or red icon or row background. Out-of-stock could be labeled clearly (and maybe auto-hidden from storefront depending on settings).

* For **POS (Point of Sale) support** (if any, as spec hints future POS features), concurrency matters: if two sales occur quickly, the system must handle it. UI-wise, we just ensure that stock numbers update (maybe via web socket or refresh). If an update fails due to a stock race condition (e.g., trying to reduce stock but it’s already sold out), we catch the error and show a user-friendly error: “Stock was updated by someone else. Current stock is 0, cannot reduce further.” (Though such a case would be rare and more backend-handled).

* Additionally, we provide **manual stock adjustment** UI: e.g., an “Adjust Stock” button on product page that opens a modal: admin can input “+/- X units” and reason (maybe reason is optional). Submitting that updates the stock and logs in audit trail. The modal closes and the new stock is reflected on screen (with perhaps a highlight effect to catch the eye).

* **Responsiveness:** The inventory list on mobile might just show product name and stock, with color badge if low. Detailed audit trails might be best viewed on desktop, but still accessible on mobile via scrolling tables or stacking.

* We ensure any critical alerts (like stock hitting zero for a top-selling item) could also be emailed, but in-app we do our part with clear alerts.

* **User Story 12 – Security & Access Control (P1):** *“As a Security Admin, I enforce strong passwords, MFA, account lockouts, RBAC, and audit logs.”* In the UI, much of this is *settings and management*:

* **User Management:** A page listing all users (staff and maybe customers if applicable) with their roles and status. The design is a table with Name, Email, Role, Last Active, MFA Enabled (could be a column with a checkmark). From here, an admin can click to **edit a user** – change their role (if allowed), reset password (send reset email), or disable the account. We enforce that roles are fixed (no custom roles in Phase 1, per spec), so likely a dropdown of {Owner, Admin, Staff, Customer} with some being tenant-specific. If Super Admin view, they can manage any user; if Store Admin, they manage their store’s users.

* **Inviting Users:** In user management, an **Invite User** button triggers a modal where admin enters email, selects role, and perhaps sends invite link. The UI confirms (“Invitation sent to user@example.com”).

* **Roles & Permissions UI:** Since roles are predefined, we might simply document what each role can do in a help tooltip or a small table. No UI for customizing permissions in MVP.

* **Security Settings:** Possibly a page in settings to configure security policies – e.g., *Password policy* (though spec fixes it: 8 char \+ complexity) so maybe it’s not editable, just enforced. *MFA enforcement:* perhaps an option “Require MFA for all admins” toggled on. If toggled, we then prompt those without MFA on login to set it up. *Session management:* maybe show active sessions for the logged-in user (especially for customers in storefront account page, and for admin in profile settings). E.g., “Logged in sessions: Chrome on Mac (this device), Safari on iPhone – Sign out other sessions”. We’d list device info and allow revoke, as spec suggests.

* **Audit Logs:** Provide a **Security Audit Log** page where important events are recorded. This could include login attempts (success/fail), password changes, role changes, etc.. The UI is a table with columns: Date/Time, User, Event, Details. We make sure sensitive info is not shown (e.g., we can show “Password changed” but not the password obviously). This page helps security admin review suspicious activity. We could allow filtering by event type or user.

* **Account Lockout:** When accounts lock after failed attempts, if the user is trying to log in on the storefront, they see an error “Account locked. Check your email to unlock or reset password.” (we send an unlock link via email). In the admin UI, an admin might see a flag on a user “Locked” and have an “Unlock” action.

* **Session Timeout/Idle:** Not heavily UI, but we might warn users before idle logout: e.g., an inactivity modal “You have been idle, you will be logged out in 1 minute. Stay logged in?” Or simply require login again after a period (since NextAuth can do sliding expiration).

* **Encryption & Compliance:** Not directly UI (mostly backend), but we ensure anywhere sensitive data is displayed, it’s done securely. For instance, when showing an API key or token, we might mask it by default and allow a “Show” button (with appropriate warnings).

* **Visual Design:** We use appropriate iconography like shield or lock icons in security-related pages. For example, MFA status could be indicated by a key icon. We use red highlights for critical security warnings. But we keep the overall style consistent; the Security pages are essentially forms and tables styled like the rest of the dashboard.

* **Responsiveness:** Security admin pages are mostly textual/tabular, so they’ll adapt like other tables (stack or scroll). Inviting and editing user modals are fine on mobile (full-screen modals).

* **User Story 13 – External Platform Integration (P2):** *“As a Store Owner, I synchronize store data with external e-commerce platforms (WooCommerce, Shopify) to maintain multi-channel presence.”* In the UI, we introduce an **Integrations page** under settings. This page lists available integrations (e.g., WooCommerce, Shopify, maybe others later). For each, the status: Not Connected or Connected.

* If not connected, a **Connect** button leads to an OAuth flow or API key entry form. E.g., for Shopify, clicking Connect might open a modal requesting the store’s Shopify domain and an admin API key/password. We provide instructions and link to where to get those. Once they input and save, we attempt a connection (API call) and show success or error feedback (“Connected successfully” or “Invalid credentials”). For WooCommerce, maybe an API key/secret and URL are needed.

* Once connected, we show status details: e.g., “Last sync: 5 min ago”, and actions like **“Sync Now”** (which triggers a manual sync). Possibly also a **“Disconnect”** button to remove the integration.

* We present info on what data is synced (products, inventory, orders). Perhaps a subtext: “Syncs products and inventory from Shopify to StormCom every 15 minutes” for clarity. We may allow toggling the direction or scope of sync (though spec says bidirectional real-time via webhooks) – but UI might not expose complexity if it’s automatic.

* We handle integration errors: if a webhook fails or credentials expire, we surface an alert on this page (or a global alert icon in nav). E.g., if Shopify sync fails due to auth, show “Shopify: Authentication failed. Please re-enter credentials.” possibly highlighted in red.

* If multi-channel inventory is complex, maybe an advanced view shows differences or conflict resolutions, but likely out of scope for now. Instead, assume straightforward syncing.

* We ensure connecting an integration is secure: the API keys likely get stored server-side; the UI only provides a means to input them. If editing, we might not show the full key again (for security) – we show a placeholder or masked and a “Revoke & Re-enter” process.

* Visually, the Integrations page uses cards or a list with logos of external platforms for quick recognition (Shopify logo, WooCommerce logo). The Connect buttons are styled consistently. We keep the style minimal (matching Vercel dashboard integrations style perhaps).

* On mobile, this list is vertical cards.

* **User Story 14 – GDPR Compliance & Data Privacy (P1):** *“As a Store Owner, I comply with GDPR by managing customer consent, handling data requests, and supporting deletion.”* The UI needs to support:

* **Consent Management:** On customer signup or newsletter signup forms on the storefront, include explicit consent checkboxes (“I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy” and maybe “I agree to receive marketing emails” if marketing is optional). These should not be pre-ticked (GDPR requires opt-in). We log the timestamp of consent. In the **customer’s account settings** (if customers can log in), allow them to view and change their consent preferences (e.g., tick/untick a newsletter subscription box). For store owners, in the admin **Customers section**, when viewing a customer profile, show their consent status (and timestamp). Possibly allow an admin to manually log or override consent if a customer gave verbal consent via phone, etc. (Though usually you’d just have them check themselves or record via a form).

* **Data Export:** In the storefront account page, a customer can request their data (by clicking “Download my data”). This triggers backend generation of a JSON or CSV as per spec. UI-wise, we either prepare it and email, or have the user revisit to download. We might simply show a message “Your data export is being prepared. You will receive an email when ready.” to handle the 72-hour window. For admin-initiated export (store owner acting on request), in the admin customer profile an admin clicks “Export Data” and after generation, can download it to send to customer. The UI needs to reflect when data is ready. Possibly a list of export requests with status, but maybe overkill – could just handle one at a time.

* **Data Deletion/Anonymization:** In the customer profile admin view, an admin can click **“Delete Personal Data”** for GDPR. We absolutely confirm this (modal: “This will anonymize all personal data of this customer. This action cannot be undone. Type DELETE to confirm.”). Once confirmed, the UI will replace personal fields with “Deleted” labels as per spec (the backend would do the anonymization, but UI should update state accordingly). We log the action in audit logs (e.g., “Customer 123 data deleted by Admin on date”). If a customer self-serves account deletion from storefront, a similar confirm (maybe requiring password re-entry) is shown, and after confirming, we log them out and show a message “Your data has been deleted.”

* **Retention Settings:** Possibly in a Compliance or Settings page, we inform store owners of the retention policy (3 years orders, 1 year audits, etc. as per spec). There might not be an UI control for it (likely fixed policy), but at least they should be aware. We could have a tooltip or info in the GDPR section: “Data retention: Orders are kept for 3 years, audit logs 1 year” etc.

* **Cookie Consent:** Not directly in spec, but GDPR implies cookie consent for tracking. We might implement a cookie banner on storefront if needed (“This site uses cookies… \[Accept\] \[Learn more\]”). Using a simple but accessible banner component at bottom, that disappears once accepted.

* **Multi-language for Policies:** The storefront will have a Privacy Policy and Terms page (maybe using our CMS feature). Ensuring those exist is part of compliance (store owner can edit their policies). Our design system provides a basic rich text page for these.

* The design for these compliance features is straightforward and emphasizes clarity. Use non-ambiguous language (no jargon). Ensure that deletion and export actions explicitly state consequences (“Your account will be permanently deleted and this cannot be undone.”). For consent checkboxes, link to policies clearly.

* We also implement a **consent audit log** – each consent change is recorded (who/when). Not necessarily a UI unless the admin wants to see a particular customer’s consent history. If needed, we could list in customer profile: “Consent given for marketing: Jan 5, 2025; Consent withdrawn: Mar 2, 2025” etc.

Each user story above corresponds to one or more interface components/pages in our Next.js app. By following this breakdown, we ensure that for every requirement in the spec, we have a concrete plan for UI implementation that adheres to modern best practices. The design system and guidelines established earlier inform all these implementations, ensuring consistency (e.g., forms in Story 14 follow the same style as forms in Story 0, tables in Story 2 and 4 share components, etc.).

We will track these tasks in our project management and implement them iteratively, regularly reviewing against the design principles to ensure the end product aligns with the vision of a **modern, performant, and user-friendly multi-tenant SaaS platform**.
