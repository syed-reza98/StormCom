# StormCom Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: Multi-tenant E-commerce Platform  
**Branch**: `001-multi-tenant-ecommerce`  
**Generated**: 2025-10-18  
**Scope**: Standard PR review gate (40-60 items)  
**Risk Focus**: Multi-tenant isolation, Payment gateway integration, External platform sync, Performance/scalability  
**Audience**: Spec author self-review

## Purpose

This checklist validates the **quality of requirements documentation** (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, constitution.md) by asking questions about requirement completeness, clarity, consistency, measurability, and coverage. This is **NOT** an implementation testing checklist—it ensures requirements are ready for development.

**Success Criteria**: Answer "YES" to ≥85% of applicable items before proceeding to implementation.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Review Method**: Read each requirement artifact (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, constitution.md)
2. **Answer Each Item**: Mark checkbox if requirement quality aspect is satisfied (documented, clear, measurable, testable)
3. **Track Gaps**: For unchecked items, note the gap in reviewer notes
4. **Prioritize Fixes**: Address CRITICAL/HIGH severity gaps (multi-tenant, payments, security) before implementation
5. **Iterate**: Re-run checklist after each remediation round until ≥85% pass rate achieved

**Key Principle**: This checklist validates requirement specification quality, NOT implementation correctness. If you find yourself testing code behavior, you're using the wrong tool—use integration/E2E tests instead.
